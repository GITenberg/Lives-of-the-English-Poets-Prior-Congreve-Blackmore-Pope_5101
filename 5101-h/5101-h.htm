<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, at the age of sixty-eight,
Johnson was writing these &ldquo;Lives of the English
Poets,&rdquo; he had caused omissions to be made from the poems
of Rochester, and was asked whether he would allow the printers
to give all the verse of Prior.&nbsp; Boswell quoted a censure by
Lord Hailes of &ldquo;those impure tales which will be the
eternal opprobrium of their ingenious author.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Johnson replied, &ldquo;Sir, Lord Hailes has forgot.&nbsp; There
is nothing in Prior that will excite to lewdness;&rdquo; and when
Boswell further urged, he put his questionings aside, and added,
&ldquo;No, sir, Prior is a lady&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; No lady is
ashamed to have it standing in her library.&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnson
distinguished strongly, as every wise man does, between offence
against convention, and offence against morality.</p>
<p>In Congreve&rsquo;s plays he recognised the wit but condemned
the morals, and in the case of Blackmore the regard for the
religious purpose of Blackmore&rsquo;s poem on &ldquo;The
Creation&rdquo; gave to Johnson, as to Addison, an undue sense of
its literary value.</p>
<p>With his &ldquo;Life of Pope,&rdquo; which occupies more than
two-thirds of this volume, Johnson took especial pains.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He wrote it,&rdquo; says Boswell, &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>con
amore</i>,&rsquo; both from the early possession which that
writer had taken of his mind, and from the pleasure which he must
have felt in for ever silencing all attempts to lessen his
poetical fame. . . . I remember once to have heard Johnson say,
&lsquo;Sir, a thousand years may elapse before there shall appear
another man with a power of versification equal to that of
Pope.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s laurel, since Johnson&rsquo;s days, has
flourished, without showing a dead bough, for all the frosts of
hostile criticism.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">H. M.</p>
<h2>PRIOR.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Matthew Prior</span> is one of those that
have burst out from an obscure original to great eminence.&nbsp;
He was born July 21, 1664, according to some, at Wimborne, in
Dorsetshire, of I know not what parents; others say that he was
the son of a joiner of London: he was perhaps willing enough to
leave his birth unsettled, in hope, like Don Quixote, that the
historian of his actions might find him some illustrious
alliance.&nbsp; He is supposed to have fallen, by his
father&rsquo;s death, into the hands of his uncle, a vintner near
Charing Cross, who sent him for some time to Dr. Busby, at
Westminster; but, not intending to give him any education beyond
that of the school, took him, when he was well advanced in
literature, to his own house, where the Earl of Dorset,
celebrated for patronage of genius, found him by chance, as
Burnet relates, reading Horace, and was so well pleased with his
proficiency, that he undertook the care and cost of his
academical education.&nbsp; He entered his name in St.
John&rsquo;s College, at Cambridge, in 1682, in his eighteenth
year; and it may be reasonably supposed that he was distinguished
among his contemporaries.&nbsp; He became a Bachelor, as is
usual, in four years, and two years afterwards wrote the poem on
the Deity, which stands first in his volume.</p>
<p>It is the established practice of that College to send every
year to the Earl of Exeter some poems upon sacred subjects, in
acknowledgment of a benefaction enjoyed by them from the bounty
of his ancestor.&nbsp; On this occasion were those verses
written, which, though nothing is said of their success, seem to
have recommended him to some notice; for his praise of the
countess&rsquo;s music, and his lines on the famous picture of
Seneca, afford reason for imagining that he was more or less
conversant with that family.</p>
<p>The same year he published &ldquo;The City Mouse and Country
Mouse,&rdquo; to ridicule Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hind and
Panther,&rdquo; in conjunction with Mr. Montague.&nbsp; There is
a story of great pain suffered, and of tears shed, on this
occasion by Dryden, who thought it hard that &ldquo;an old man
should be so treated by those to whom he had always been
civil.&rdquo;&nbsp; By tales like these is the envy raised by
superior abilities every day gratified.&nbsp; When they are
attacked every one hopes to see them humbled; what is hoped is
readily believed, and what is believed is confidently told.&nbsp;
Dryden had been more accustomed to hostilities than that such
enemies should break his quiet; and, if we can suppose him vexed,
it would be hard to deny him sense enough to conceal his
uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City Mouse and Country Mouse&rdquo; procured its
authors more solid advantages than the pleasure of fretting
Dryden, for they were both speedily preferred.&nbsp; Montague,
indeed, obtained the first notice with some degree of discontent,
as it seems, in Prior, who probably knew that his own part of the
performance was the best.&nbsp; He had not, however, much reason
to complain, for he came to London and obtained such notice that
(in 1691) he was sent to the Congress at the Hague as secretary
to the embassy.&nbsp; In this assembly of princes and nobles, to
which Europe has perhaps scarcely seen anything equal, was formed
the grand alliance against Louis, which at last did not produce
effects proportionate so the magnificence of the transaction.</p>
<p>The conduct of Prior, in this splendid initiation into public
business, was so pleasing to King William, that he made him one
of the gentlemen of his bedchamber; and he is supposed to have
passed some of the next years in the quiet cultivation of
literature and poetry.</p>
<p>The death of Queen Mary (in 1695) produced a subject for all
the writers&mdash;perhaps no funeral was ever so poetically
attended.&nbsp; Dryden, indeed, as a man discountenanced and
deprived, was silent; but scarcely any other maker of verses
omitted to bring his tribute of tuneful sorrow.&nbsp; An
emulation of elegy was universal.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s praise was
not confined to the English language, but fills a great part of
the <i>Mus&aelig; Anglican&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p>Prior, who was both a poet and a courtier, was too diligent to
miss this opportunity of respect.&nbsp; He wrote a long ode,
which was presented to the king, by whom it was not likely to be
ever read.&nbsp; In two years he was secretary to another embassy
at the Treaty of Ryswick (in 1697), and next year had the same
office at the court of France, where he is said to have been
considered with great distinction.&nbsp; As he was one day
surveying the apartments at Versailles, being shown the
&ldquo;Victories of Louis,&rdquo; painted by Le Brun, and asked
whether the King of England&rsquo;s palace had any such
decorations: &ldquo;The monuments of my master&rsquo;s
actions,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are to be seen everywhere but in
his own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pictures of Le Brun are not only in themselves
sufficiently ostentatious, but were explained by inscriptions so
arrogant, that Boileau and Racine thought it necessary to make
them more simple.&nbsp; He was in the following year at Leo with
the king, from whom, after a long audience, he carried orders to
England, and upon his arrival became Under Secretary of State in
the Earl of Jersey&rsquo;s office, a post which he did not retain
long, because Jersey was removed, but he was soon made
Commissioner of Trade.</p>
<p>This year (1700) produced one of his longest and most splendid
compositions, the &ldquo;Carmen Seculare,&rdquo; in which he
exhausts all his powers of celebration.&nbsp; I mean not to
accuse him of flattery; he probably thought all that he writ, and
retained as much veracity as can be properly exacted from a poet
professedly encomiastic.&nbsp; King William supplied copious
materials for either verse or prose.&nbsp; His whole life had
been action, and none ever denied him the resplendent qualities
of steady resolution and personal courage.&nbsp; He was really in
Prior&rsquo;s mind what he represents him in his verses; he
considered him as a hero, and was accustomed to say that he
praised others in compliance with the fashion, but that in
celebrating King William he followed his inclination.&nbsp; To
Prior, gratitude would dictate praise, which reason would not
refuse.</p>
<p>Among the advantages to arise from the future years of
William&rsquo;s reign, he mentions a Society for Useful Arts, and
among them:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Some that with care true eloquence shall
teach,<br />
And to just idioms fix our doubtful speech;<br />
That from our writers distant realms may know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thanks we to our monarchs owe,<br />
And schools profess our tongue through every land<br />
That has invoked his aid, or blessed his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tickell, in his &ldquo;Prospect of Peace,&rdquo; has the same
hope of a new academy:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;In happy chains our daring language
bound,<br />
Shall sport no more in arbitrary sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the similitude of those passages, which exhibit the
same thought on the same occasion, proceeded from accident or
imitation, is not easy to determine.&nbsp; Tickell might have
been impressed with his expectation by Swift&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Proposal for Ascertaining the English Language,&rdquo;
then lately published.</p>
<p>In the Parliament that met in 1701 he was chosen
representative of East Grinstead.&nbsp; Perhaps it was about this
time that he changed his party, for he voted for the impeachment
of those lords who had persuaded the king to the Partition
Treaty, a treaty in which he himself had been ministerially
employed.</p>
<p>A great part of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign was a time of war, in
which there was little employment for negotiators, and Prior had,
therefore, leisure to make or to polish verses.&nbsp; When the
Battle of Blenheim called forth all the verse-men, Prior, among
the rest, took care to show his delight in the increasing honour
of his country by an epistle to Boileau.&nbsp; He published, soon
afterwards, a volume of poems, with the encomiastic character of
his deceased patron, the Earl of Dorset.&nbsp; It began with the
College exercise, and ended with the &ldquo;Nutbrown
Maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Battle of Ramillies soon afterwards (in 1706) excited him
to another effort of poetry.&nbsp; On this occasion he had fewer
or less formidable rivals, and it would be not easy to name any
other composition produced by that event which is now
remembered.</p>
<p>Everything has its day.&nbsp; Through the reigns of William
and Anne no prosperous event passed undignified by poetry.&nbsp;
In the last war, when France was disgraced and overpowered in
every quarter of the globe, when Spain, coming to her assistance,
only shared her calamities, and the name of an Englishman was
reverenced through Europe, no poet was heard amidst the general
acclamation; the fame of our counsellors and heroes was entrusted
to the <i>Gazetteer</i>.&nbsp; The nation in time grew weary of
the war, and the queen grew weary of her ministers.&nbsp; The war
was burdensome, and the ministers were insolent.&nbsp; Harley and
his friends began to hope that they might, by driving the Whigs
from court and from power, gratify at once the queen and the
people.&nbsp; There was now a call for writers, who might convey
intelligence of past abuses, and show the waste of public money,
the unreasonable conduct of the allies, the avarice of generals,
the tyranny of minions, and the general danger of approaching
ruin.&nbsp; For this purpose a paper called the <i>Examiner</i>
was periodically published, written, as it happened, by any wit
of the party, and sometimes, as is said, by Mrs. Manley.&nbsp;
Some are owned by Swift; and one, in ridicule of Garth&rsquo;s
verses to Godolphin upon the loss of his place, was written by
Prior, and answered by Addison, who appears to have known the
author either by conjecture or intelligence.</p>
<p>The Tories, who were now in power, were in haste to end the
war, and Prior, being recalled (1710) to his former employment of
making treaties, was sent (July, 1711) privately to Paris with
propositions of peace.&nbsp; He was remembered at the French
court; and, returning in about a month, brought with him the
Abb&eacute; Gaultier and M. Mesnager, a minister from France,
invested with full powers.&nbsp; This transaction not being
avowed, Mackay, the master of the Dover packet-boat, either
zealously or officiously, seized Prior and his associates at
Canterbury.&nbsp; It is easily supposed they were soon
released.</p>
<p>The negotiation was begun at Prior&rsquo;s house, where the
queen&rsquo;s ministers met Mesnager (September 20, 1711), and
entered privately upon the great business.&nbsp; The importance
of Prior appears from the mention made of him by St. John in his
letter to the queen:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord Treasurer moved, and all my Lords were of the
same opinion, that Mr. Prior should be added to those who are
empowered to sign; the reason for which is because he, having
personally treated with Monsieur de Torcy, is the best witness we
can produce of the sense in which the general preliminary
engagements are entered into; besides which, as he is the best
versed in matters of trade of all your Majesty&rsquo;s servants
who have been trusted in this secret, if you shall think fit to
employ him in the future treaty of commerce, it will be of
consequence that he has been a party concerned in concluding that
convention, which must be the rule of this treaty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assembly of this important night was in some degree
clandestine, the design of treaty not being yet openly declared
and when the Whigs returned to power was aggravated to a charge
of high treason; though, as Prior remarks in his imperfect answer
to the Report of the Committee of Secrecy, no treaty ever was
made without private interviews and preliminary discussions.</p>
<p>My business is not the history of the peace, but the life of
Prior.&nbsp; The conferences began at Utrecht on the 1st of
January (1711&ndash;12), and the English plenipotentiaries
arrived on the 15th.&nbsp; The ministers of the different
potentates conferred and conferred; but the peace advanced so
slowly that speedier methods were found necessary, and
Bolingbroke was sent to Paris to adjust differences with less
formality.&nbsp; Prior either accompanied him or followed him,
and after his departure had the appointments and authority of an
ambassador, though no public character.&nbsp; By some mistake of
the queen&rsquo;s orders the court of France had been disgusted,
and Bolingbroke says in his letter, &ldquo;Dear Mat,&mdash;Hide
the nakedness of thy country, and give the best turn thy fertile
brain will furnish thee with to the blunders of thy countrymen,
who are not much better politicians than the French are
poets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after, the Duke of Shrewsbury went on a formal embassy to
Paris.&nbsp; It is related by Boyer that the intention was to
have joined Prior in the commission, but that Shrewsbury refused
to be associated with a man so meanly born.&nbsp; Prior therefore
continued to act without a title till the duke returned next year
to England, and then he assumed the style and dignity of
ambassador.&nbsp; But while he continued in appearance a private
man, he was treated with confidence by Louis, who sent him with a
letter to the queen, written in favour of the Elector of
Bavaria.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall expect,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;with
impatience, the return of Mr. Prior, whose conduct is very
agreeable to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while the Duke of Shrewsbury
was still at Paris, Bolingbroke wrote to Prior
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Monsieur de Torcy has a confidence in you;
make use of it, once for all, upon this occasion, and convince
him thoroughly that we must give a different turn to our
Parliament and our people according to their resolution at this
crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prior&rsquo;s public dignity and splendour commenced in
August, 1713, and continued till the August following; but I am
afraid that, according to the usual fate of greatness, it was
attended with some perplexities and mortifications.&nbsp; He had
not all that is customarily given to ambassadors: he hints to the
queen in an imperfect poem that he had no service of plate; and
it appeared by the debts which he contracted that his remittances
were not punctually made.</p>
<p>On the 1st of August, 1714, ensued the downfall of the Tories
and the degradation of Prior.&nbsp; He was recalled, but was not
able to return, being detained by the debts which he had found it
necessary to contract, and which were not discharged before
March, though his old friend Montague was now at the head of the
Treasury.&nbsp; He returned, then, as soon as he could, and was
welcomed on the 25th of March by a warrant, but was, however,
suffered to live in his own house, under the custody of the
messenger, till he was examined before a committee of the Privy
Council, of which Mr. Walpole was chairman, and Lord Coningsby,
Mr. Stanhope, and Mr. Lechmere were the principal interrogators,
who, in this examination, of which there is printed an account
not unentertaining, behaved with the boisterousness of men elated
by recent authority.&nbsp; They are represented as asking
questions sometimes vague, sometimes insidious, and writing
answers different from those which they received.&nbsp; Prior,
however, seems to have been overpowered by their turbulence; for
he confesses that he signed what, if he had ever come before a
legal judicature, he should have contradicted or explained
away.&nbsp; The oath was administered by Boscawen, a Middlesex
justice, who at last was going to write his attestation on the
wrong side of the paper.&nbsp; They were very industrious to find
some charge against Oxford, and asked Prior, with great
earnestness, who was present when the preliminary articles were
talked of or signed at his house?&nbsp; He told them that either
the Earl of Oxford or the Duke of Shrewsbury was absent, but he
could not remember which, an answer which perplexed them, because
it supplied no accusation against either.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could
anything be more absurd,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;or more inhuman,
than to propose to me a question, by the answering of which I
might, according to them, prove myself a traitor?&nbsp; And
notwithstanding their solemn promise that nothing which I should
say should hurt myself, I had no reason to trust them, for they
violated that promise about five hours after.&nbsp; However, I
owned I was there present.&nbsp; Whether this was wisely done or
no I leave to my friends to determine.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he had
signed the paper, he was told by Walpole that the committee were
not satisfied with his behaviour, nor could give such an account
of it to the Commons as might merit favour; and that they now
thought a stricter confinement necessary than to his own
house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Boscawen played
the moralist, and Coningsby the Christian, but both very
awkwardly.&rdquo;&nbsp; The messenger, in whose custody he was to
be placed, was then called, and very indecently asked by
Coningsby &ldquo;if his house was secured by bars and
bolts.&rdquo;&nbsp; The messenger answered, &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
with astonishment.&nbsp; At which Coningsby very angrily said,
&ldquo;Sir, you must secure this prisoner; it is for the safety
of the nation: if he escape, you shall answer for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had already printed their report; and in this examination
were endeavouring to find proofs.</p>
<p>He continued thus confined for some time; and Mr. Walpole
(June 10, 1715) moved for an impeachment against him.&nbsp; What
made him so acrimonious does not appear; he was by nature no
thirster for blood.&nbsp; Prior was a week after committed to
close custody, with orders that &ldquo;no person should be
admitted to see him without leave from the Speaker.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When, two years after, an Act of Grace was passed, he was
excepted, and continued still in custody, which he had made less
tedious by writing his &ldquo;Alma.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was, however,
soon after discharged.&nbsp; He had now his liberty, but he had
nothing else.&nbsp; Whatever the profit of his employments might
have been, he had always spent it; and at the age of fifty-three
was, with all his abilities, in danger of penury, having yet no
solid revenue but from the fellowship of his college, which, when
in his exaltation he was censured for retaining it, he said he
could live upon at last.&nbsp; Being, however, generally known
and esteemed, he was encouraged to add other poems to those which
he had printed, and to publish them by subscription.&nbsp; The
expedient succeeded by the industry of many friends, who
circulated the proposals, and the care of some who, it is said,
withheld the money from him lest he should squander it.&nbsp; The
price of the volume was two guineas; the whole collection was
four thousand; to which Lord Harley, the son of the Earl of
Oxford, to whom he had invariably adhered, added an equal sum for
the purchase of Down Hall, which Prior was to enjoy during life,
and Harley after his decease.&nbsp; He had now, what wits and
philosophers have often wished, the power of passing the day in
contemplative tranquillity.&nbsp; But it seems that busy men
seldom live long in a state of quiet.&nbsp; It is not unlikely
that his health declined, he complains of deafness;
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I took little care of my ears
while I was not sure if my head was my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of any occurrences of his remaining life I have found no
account.&nbsp; In a letter to Swift, &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;treated Lady Harriet, at Cambridge (a Fellow of a
College treat!) and spoke verses to her in a gown and cap!&nbsp;
What, the plenipotentiary, so far concerned in the damned peace
at Utrecht; the man that makes up half the volume of terse prose,
that makes up the report of the committee, speaking verses!&nbsp;
<i>Sic est</i>, <i>homo sum</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He died at Wimpole, a seat of the Earl of Oxford, on the 18th
of September, 1721, and was buried in Westminster; where on a
monument, for which, as the &ldquo;last piece of human
vanity,&rdquo; he left five hundred pounds, is engraven this
epitaph:&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Of Prior, eminent as he was, both by his abilities and
station, very few memorials have been left by his contemporaries;
the account, therefore, must now be destitute of his private
character and familiar practices.&nbsp; He lived at a time when
the rage of party detected all which it was any man&rsquo;s
interest to hide; and, as little ill is heard of Prior, it is
certain that not much was known.&nbsp; He was not afraid of
provoking censure; for when he forsook the Whigs, under whose
patronage he first entered the world, he became a Tory so ardent
and determinate, that he did not willingly consort with men of
different opinions.&nbsp; He was one of the sixteen Tories who
met weekly, and agreed to address each other by the title of
<i>Brother</i>; and seems to have adhered, not only by
concurrence of political designs, but by peculiar affection, to
the Earl of Oxford and his family.&nbsp; With how much confidence
he was trusted has been already told.</p>
<p>He was, however, in Pope&rsquo;s opinion, fit only to make
verses, and less qualified for business than Addison
himself.&nbsp; This was surely said without consideration.&nbsp;
Addison, exalted to a high place, was forced into degradation by
the sense of his own incapacity; Prior, who was employed by men
very capable of estimating his value, having been secretary to
one embassy, had, when great abilities were again wanted, the
same office another time; and was, after so much experience of
his own knowledge and dexterity, at last sent to transact a
negotiation in the highest degree arduous and important, for
which he was qualified, among other requisites, in the opinion of
Bolingbroke, by his influence upon the French minister, and by
skill in questions of commerce above other men.</p>
<p>Of his behaviour in the lighter parts of life, it is too late
to get much intelligence.&nbsp; One of his answers to a boastful
Frenchman has been related; and to an impertinent he made another
equally proper.&nbsp; During his embassy he sat at the opera by a
man who, in his rapture, accompanied with his own voice the
principal singer.</p>
<p>Prior fell to railing at the performer with all the terms of
reproach that he could collect, till the Frenchman, ceasing from
his song, began to expostulate with him for his harsh censure of
a man who was confessedly the ornament of the stage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; says the ambassador, &ldquo;mais
il chante si haut, que je ne s&ccedil;aurois vous
entendre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a gay French company, where every one sang a little song or
stanza, of which the burden was &ldquo;Bannissons la
M&eacute;lancolie,&rdquo; when it came to his turn to sing, after
the performance of a young lady that sat next him, he produced
these extemporary lines:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Mais cette voix, et ces beaux yeux,<br
/>
Font Cupidon trop dangereux,<br />
Et je suis triste quand je crie<br />
Bannissons la M&eacute;lancolie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tradition represents him as willing to descend from the
dignity of the poet and statesman to the low delights of mean
company.&nbsp; His Chloe probably was sometimes ideal: but the
woman with whom he cohabited was a despicable drab of the lowest
species.&nbsp; One of his wenches, perhaps Chloe, while he was
absent from his house, stole his plate and ran away, as was
related by a woman who had been his servant.&nbsp; Of his
propensity to sordid converse, I have seen an account so
seriously ridiculous, that it seems to deserve insertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been assured that Prior, after having spent the
evening with Oxford, Bolingbroke, Pope, and Swift, would go and
smoke a pipe and drink a bottle of ale with a common soldier and
his wife in Long Acre before he went to bed, not from any remains
of the lowness of his original, as one said, but I suppose that
his faculties&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;strained to the height,<br
/>
In that celestial colloquy sublime,<br />
Dazzled and spent, sunk down, and sought
repair.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Prior; why was he so <i>strained</i>, and in such <i>want
of repair</i>, after a conversation with men not, in the opinion
of the world, much wiser than himself?&nbsp; But such are the
conceits of speculatists, who <i>strain</i> their
<i>faculties</i> to find in a mine what lies upon the
surface.&nbsp; His opinions, so far as the means of judging are
left us, seem to have been right; but his life was, it seems,
irregular, negligent, and sensual.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Prior</span> has written with great
variety, and his variety has made him popular.&nbsp; He has tried
all styles, from the grotesque to the solemn, and has not so
failed in any as to incur derision or disgrace.&nbsp; His works
may be distinctly considered as comprising Tales, Love Verses,
Occasional Poems, &ldquo;Alma,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Solomon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tales have obtained general approbation, being written
with great familiarity and great sprightliness; the language is
easy, but seldom gross, and the numbers smooth, without
appearance of care.&nbsp; Of these tales there are only four:
&ldquo;The Ladle,&rdquo; which is introduced by a preface,
neither necessary nor pleasing, neither grave nor merry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Paulo Purganti,&rdquo; which has likewise a preface, but
of more value than the tale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hans Carvel,&rdquo; not
over-decent; and &ldquo;Protogenes and Apelles,&rdquo; an old
story mingled, by an affectation not disagreeable, with modern
images.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Young Gentleman in Love&rdquo; has
hardly a just claim to the title of a tale.&nbsp; I know not
whether he be the original author of any tale which he has given
us.&nbsp; The adventure of Hans Carvel has passed through many
successions of merry wits, for it is to be found in
Ariosto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Satires,&rdquo; and is perhaps yet
older.&nbsp; But the merit of such stories is the art of telling
them.</p>
<p>In his amorous effusions he is less happy; for they are not
dictated by nature or by passion, and have neither gallantry nor
tenderness.&nbsp; They have the coldness of Cowley, without his
wit, the dull exercises of a skilful versifier, resolved at all
adventures to write something about Chloe, and trying to be
amorous by dint of study.&nbsp; His fictions, therefore, are
mythological.&nbsp; Venus, after the example of the Greek
epigram, asks when she was seen <i>naked and bathing</i>.&nbsp;
Then Cupid is <i>mistaken</i>; then Cupid is <i>disarmed</i>;
then he loses his darts to Ganymede; then Jupiter sends him a
summons by Mercury.&nbsp; Then Chloe goes a-hunting with an
<i>ivory quiver graceful at her side</i>; Diana mistakes her for
one of her nymphs, and Cupid laughs at the blunder.&nbsp; All
this is surely despicable; and even when he tries to act the
lover without the help of gods or goddesses, his thoughts are
unaffecting or remote.&nbsp; He talks not &ldquo;like a man of
this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The greatest of all his amorous essays is &ldquo;Henry and
Emma,&rdquo; a dull and tedious dialogue, which excites neither
esteem for the man nor tenderness for the woman.&nbsp; The
example of Emma, who resolves to follow an outlawed murderer
wherever fear and guilt shall drive him, deserves no imitation;
and the experiment by which Henry tries the lady&rsquo;s
constancy is such as must end either in infamy to her or in
disappointment to himself.</p>
<p>His occasional poems necessarily lost part of their value, as
their occasions, being less remembered, raised less emotion, Some
of them, however, are preserved by their inherent
excellence.&nbsp; The burlesque of Boileau&rsquo;s ode on Namur
has in some parts such airiness and levity as will always procure
it readers, even among those who cannot compare it with the
original.&nbsp; The epistle to Boileau is not so happy.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Poems to the King,&rdquo; are now perused only by young
students, who read merely that they may learn to write; and of
the &ldquo;Carmen Seculare,&rdquo; I cannot but suspect that I
might praise or censure it by caprice without danger of
detection; for who can be supposed to have laboured through
it?&nbsp; Yet the time has been when this neglected work was so
popular that it was translated into Latin by no common
master.</p>
<p>His poem on the Battle of Ramillies is necessarily tedious by
the form of the stanza.&nbsp; An uniform mass of ten lines
thirty-five times repeated, inconsequential and slightly
connected, must weary both the ear and the understanding.&nbsp;
His imitation of Spenser, which consists principally in <i>I
ween</i> and <i>I weet</i>, without exclusion of later modes of
speech, makes his poem neither ancient nor modern.&nbsp; His
mention of Mars and Bellona, and his comparison of Marlborough to
the eagle that bears the thunder of Jupiter, are all puerile and
unaffecting; and yet more despicable is the long tale told by
Louis in his despair of Brute and Troynovante, and the teeth of
Cadmus, with his similes of the raven and eagle and wolf and
lion.&nbsp; By the help of such easy fictions and vulgar topics,
without acquaintance with life, and without knowledge of art or
nature, a poem of any length, cold and lifeless like this, may be
easily written on any subject.</p>
<p>In his epilogues to Ph&aelig;dra and to Lucius he is very
happily facetious; but in the prologue before the queen the
pedant has found his way with Minerva, Perseus, and
Andromeda.</p>
<p>His epigrams and lighter pieces are, like those of others,
sometimes elegant, sometimes trifling, and sometimes dull; among
the best are the &ldquo;Chamelion&rdquo; and the epitaph on John
and Joan.</p>
<p>Scarcely any one of our poets has written so much and
translated so little: the version of Callimachus is sufficiently
licentious; the paraphrase on St. Paul&rsquo;s Exhortation to
Charity is eminently beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alma&rdquo; is written in professed imitation of
&ldquo;Hudibras,&rdquo; and has at least one accidental
resemblance: &ldquo;Hudibras&rdquo; wants a plan because it is
left imperfect; &ldquo;Alma&rdquo; is imperfect because it seems
never to have had a plan.&nbsp; Prior appears not to have
proposed to himself any drift or design, but to have written the
casual dictates of the present moment.</p>
<p>What Horace said when he imitated Lucilius, might be said of
Butler by Prior; his numbers were not smooth nor neat.&nbsp;
Prior excelled him in versification; but he was, like Horace,
<i>inventore minor</i>; he had not Butler&rsquo;s exuberance of
matter and variety of illustration.&nbsp; The spangles of wit
which he could afford he knew how to polish; but he wanted the
bullion of his master.&nbsp; Butler pours out a negligent
profusion, certain of the weight, but careless of the
stamp.&nbsp; Prior has comparatively little, but with that little
he makes a fine show.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alma&rdquo; has many admirers,
and was the only piece among Prior&rsquo;s works of which Pope
said that he should wish to be the author.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; is the work to which he entrusted the
protection of his name, and which he expected succeeding ages to
regard with veneration.&nbsp; His affection was natural; it had
undoubtedly been written with great labour; and who is willing to
think that he has been labouring in vain?&nbsp; He had infused
into it much knowledge and much thought; had often polished it to
elegance, often dignified it with splendour, and sometimes
heightened it to sublimity: he perceived in it many excellences,
and did not discover that it wanted that without which all others
are of small avail&mdash;the power of engaging attention and
alluring curiosity.</p>
<p>Tediousness is the most fatal of all faults; negligence or
errors are single and local, but tediousness pervades the whole;
other faults are censured and forgotten, but the power of
tediousness propagates itself.&nbsp; He that is weary the first
hour is more weary the second, as bodies forced into motion,
contrary to their tendency, pass more and more slowly through
every successive interval of space.&nbsp; Unhappily this
pernicious failure is that which an author is least able to
discover.&nbsp; We are seldom tiresome to ourselves; and the act
of composition fills and delights the mind with change of
language and succession of images.&nbsp; Every couplet, when
produced, is new, and novelty is the great source of
pleasure.&nbsp; Perhaps no man ever thought a line superfluous
when he first wrote it, or contracted his work till his
ebullitions of invention had subsided.&nbsp; And even if he
should control his desire of immediate renown, and keep his work
<i>nine years</i> unpublished, he will be still the author, and
still in danger of deceiving himself: and if he consults his
friends he will probably find men who have more kindness than
judgment, or more fear to offend than desire to instruct.&nbsp;
The tediousness of this poem proceeds not from the uniformity of
the subject, for it is sufficiently diversified, but from the
continued tenor of the narration; in which Solomon relates the
successive vicissitudes of his own mind without the intervention
of any other speaker or the mention of any other agent, unless it
be Abra; the reader is only to learn what he thought, and to be
told that he thought wrong.&nbsp; The event of every experiment
is foreseen, and therefore the process is not much
regarded.&nbsp; Yet the work is far from deserving to be
neglected.&nbsp; He that shall peruse it will be able to mark
many passages to which he may recur for instruction or delight;
many from which the poet may learn to write and the philosopher
to reason.</p>
<p>If Prior&rsquo;s poetry be generally considered, his praise
will be that of correctness and industry, rather than of compass
of comprehension or activity of fancy.&nbsp; He never made any
effort of invention: his greater pieces are only tissues of
common thoughts; and his smaller, which consist of light images
or single conceits, are not always his own.&nbsp; I have traced
him among the French epigrammatists, and have been informed that
he poached for prey among obscure authors.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Thief
and Cordelier&rdquo; is, I suppose, generally considered as an
original production, with how much justice this epigram may tell,
which was written by Georgius Sabinus, a poet now little known or
read, though once the friend of Luther and Melancthon:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">&ldquo;De
<i>Sacerdote Furem consolante</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Quidam sacrificus furem comitatus
euntem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Huc ubi dat sontes carnificina neci.<br />
Ne sis m&oelig;stus, ait; summi conviva Tonantis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jam cum coelitibus (si modo credis) eris.<br />
Ille gemens, si vera mihi solatia pr&aelig;bes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospes apud superos sis meus oro, refert.<br />
Sacrificus contra; mihi non convivia fas est<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ducere, jejunas hac edo luce nihil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he has valuable he owes to his diligence and his
judgment.&nbsp; His diligence has justly placed him amongst the
most correct of the English poets; and he was one of the first
that resolutely endeavoured at correctness.&nbsp; He never
sacrifices accuracy to haste, nor indulges himself in
contemptuous negligence, or impatient idleness; he has no
careless lines, or entangled sentiments; his words are nicely
selected, and his thoughts fully expanded.&nbsp; If this part of
his character suffers an abatement, it must be from the
disproportion of his rhymes, which have not always sufficient
consonance, and from the admission of broken lines into his
&ldquo;Solomon;&rdquo; but perhaps he thought, like Cowley, that
hemistichs ought to be admitted into heroic poetry.</p>
<p>He had apparently such rectitude of judgment as secured him
from everything that approached to the ridiculous or absurd; but
as law operates in civil agency, not to the excitement of virtue,
but the repression of wickedness, so judgment in the operations
of intellect can hinder faults, but not produce excellence.&nbsp;
Prior is never low, nor very often sublime.&nbsp; It is said by
Longinus of Euripides, that he forces himself sometimes into
grandeur by violence of effort, as the lion kindles his fury by
the lashes of his own tail.&nbsp; Whatever Prior obtains above
mediocrity seems the effort of struggle and of toil.&nbsp; He has
many vigorous, but few happy lines; he has everything by
purchase, and nothing by gift; he had no <i>nightly
visitations</i> of the Muse, no infusions of sentiment or
felicities of fancy.&nbsp; His diction, however, is more his own
than of any among the successors of Dryden; he borrows no lucky
turns, or commodious modes of language, from his
predecessors.&nbsp; His phrases are original, but they are
sometimes harsh; as he inherited no elegances, none has he
bequeathed.&nbsp; His expression has every mark of laborious
study, the line seldom seems to have been formed at once; the
words did not come till they were called, and were then put by
constraint into their places, where they do their duty, but do it
sullenly.&nbsp; In his greater compositions there may be found
more rigid stateliness than graceful dignity.</p>
<p>Of versification he was not negligent.&nbsp; What he received
from Dryden he did not lose; neither did he increase the
difficulty of writing by unnecessary severity, but uses triplets
and alexandrines without scruple.&nbsp; In his preface to
&ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; he proposes some improvements by extending
the sense from one couplet to another with variety of
pauses.&nbsp; This he has attempted, but without success; his
interrupted lines are unpleasing, and his sense, as less
distinct, is less striking.&nbsp; He has altered the stanza of
Spenser as a house is altered by building another in its place of
a different form.&nbsp; With how little resemblance he has formed
his new stanza to that of his master these specimens will
show:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SPENSER.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She flying fast from
Heaven&rsquo;s fated face,<br />
And from the world that her discovered wide,<br />
Fled to the wasteful wilderness space,<br />
From living eyes her open shame to hide,<br />
And lurked in rocks and caves long unespied.<br />
But that fair crew of knights, and Una fair,<br />
Did in that castle afterwards abide,<br />
To rest themselves, and weary powers repair,<br />
Where store they found of all that dainty was and
rare?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PRIOR.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;To the close rock the
frightened raven flies,<br />
Soon as the rising eagle cuts the air;<br />
The shaggy wolf unseen and trembling lies,<br />
When the hoarse roar proclaims the lion near.<br />
Ill-starred did we our forts and lines forsake,<br />
To dare our British foes to open fight:<br />
Our conquest we by stratagem should make;<br />
Our triumph had been founded in our flight.<br />
&rsquo;Tis ours by craft and by surprise to gain;<br />
&rsquo;Tis theirs to meet in arms, and battle in the
plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this new structure of his lines he has avoided
difficulties; nor am I sure that he has lost any of the power of
pleasing, but he no longer imitates Spencer.&nbsp; Some of his
poems are written without regularity of measures; for, when he
commenced poet, he had not recovered from our Pindaric
infatuation; but he probably lived to be convinced that the
essence of verse is order and consonance.&nbsp; His numbers are
such as mere diligence may attain; they seldom offend the ear,
and seldom soothe it; they commonly want airiness, lightness, and
facility.&nbsp; What is smooth is not soft.&nbsp; His verses
always roll, but they seldom flow.</p>
<p>A survey of the life and writings of Prior may exemplify a
sentence which he doubtless understood well when he read Horace
at his uncle&rsquo;s, &ldquo;The vessel long retains the scent
which it first receives.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his private relaxation
he revived the tavern, and in his amorous pedantry he exhibited
the college.&nbsp; But on higher occasions and nobler subjects,
when habit was overpowered by the necessity of reflection, he
wanted not wisdom as a statesman, or elegance as a poet.</p>
<h2>CONGREVE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">William Congreve</span> descended from a
family in Staffordshire of so great antiquity, that it claims a
place among the few that extend their hue beyond the Norman
Conquest, and was the son of William Congreve, second son of
Richard Congreve, of Congreve and Stratton.&nbsp; He visited,
once at least, the residence of his ancestors; and, I believe,
more places than one are still shown in groves and gardens, where
he is related to have written his <i>Old Bachelor</i>.</p>
<p>Neither the time nor place of his birth is certainly
known.&nbsp; If the inscription upon his monument be true, he was
born in 1672.&nbsp; For the place, it was said by himself that he
owed his nativity to England, and by everybody else that he was
born in Ireland.&nbsp; Southern mentioned him with sharp censure
as a man that meanly disowned his native country.&nbsp; The
biographers assigned his nativity to Bardsa, near Leeds, in
Yorkshire, from the account given by himself, as they suppose, to
Jacob.&nbsp; To doubt whether a man of eminence has told the
truth about his own birth is, in appearance, to be very deficient
in candour; yet nobody can live long without knowing that
falsehoods of convenience or vanity, falsehoods from which no
evil immediately visible ensues, except the general degradation
of human testimony, are very lightly uttered, and once uttered
are sullenly supported.&nbsp; Boileau, who desired to be thought
a rigorous and steady moralist, having told a pretty lie to Louis
XIV., continued it afterwards by false dates; thinking himself
obliged <i>in honour</i>, says his admirer, to maintain what,
when he said it, was so well received.&nbsp; [Congreve was
baptised at Bardsey, February 10, 1670.]</p>
<p>Wherever Congreve was born, he was educated first at Kilkenny,
and afterwards at Dublin, his father having some military
employment that stationed him in Ireland; but after having passed
through the usual preparatory studies, as may be reasonably
supposed, with great celerity and success, his father thought it
proper to assign him a profession, by which something might be
gotten, and about the time of the Revolution sent him, at the age
of sixteen, to study law in the Middle Temple, where he lived for
several years, but with very little attention to statutes or
reports.&nbsp; His disposition to become an author appeared very
early, as he very early felt that force of imagination, and
possessed that copiousness of sentiment, by which intellectual
pleasure can be given.&nbsp; His first performance was a novel
called &ldquo;Incognita; or, Love and Duty Reconciled;&rdquo; it
is praised by the biographers, who quote some part of the
preface, that is, indeed, for such a time of life, uncommonly
judicious.&nbsp; I would rather praise it than read it.</p>
<p>His first dramatic labour was <i>The Old Bachelor</i>, of
which he says, in his defence against Collier, &ldquo;That comedy
was written, as several know, some years before it was
acted.&nbsp; When I wrote it I had little thoughts of the stage;
but did it to amuse myself in a slow recovery from a fit of
sickness.&nbsp; Afterwards, through my indiscretion it was seen,
and in some little time more it was acted; and I, through the
remainder of my indiscretion suffered myself to be drawn into the
prosecution of a difficult and thankless study, and to be
involved in a perpetual war with knaves and fools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seems to be a strange affectation in authors of
appearing to have done everything by chance.&nbsp; <i>The Old
Bachelor</i> was written for amusement in the languor of
convalescence.&nbsp; Yet it is apparently composed with great
elaborateness of dialogue, and incessant ambition of wit.&nbsp;
The age of the writer considered, it is indeed a very wonderful
performance; for, whenever written, it was acted (1693) when he
was not more than twenty-one years old; and was then recommended
by Mr. Dryden, Mr. Southern, and Mr. Maynwaring.&nbsp; Dryden
said that he never had seen such a first play; but they found it
deficient in some things necessary to the success of its
exhibition, and by their greater experience fitted it for the
stage.&nbsp; Southern used to relate of one comedy, probably of
this, that when Congreve read it to the players he pronounced it
so wretchedly, that they had almost rejected it; but they were
afterwards so well persuaded of its excellence that, for half a
year before it was acted, the manager allowed its author the
privilege of the house.</p>
<p>Few plays have ever been so beneficial to the writer, for it
procured him the patronage of Halifax, who immediately made him
one of the commissioners for licensing coaches, and soon after
gave him a place in the Pipe-office, and another in the Customs,
of six hundred pounds a year.&nbsp; Congreve&rsquo;s conversation
must surely have been at least equally pleasing with his
writings.</p>
<p>Such a comedy, written at such an age, requires some
consideration.&nbsp; As the lighter species of dramatic poetry
professes the imitation of common life, of real manners, and
daily incidents, it apparently presupposes a familiar knowledge
of many characters, and exact observation of the passing world;
the difficulty, therefore, is to conceive how this knowledge can
be obtained by a boy.</p>
<p>But if <i>The Old Bachelor</i> be more nearly examined, it
will be found to be one of those comedies which may be made by a
mind vigorous and acute, and furnished with comic characters by
the perusal of other poets, without much actual commerce with
mankind.&nbsp; The dialogue is one constant reciprocation of
conceits or clash of wit, in which nothing flows necessarily from
the occasion, or is dictated by nature.&nbsp; The characters,
both of men and women, are either fictitious and artificial, as
those of Heartwell and the ladies, or easy and common, as Wittol,
a tame idiot; Bluff, a swaggering coward; and Fondlewife, a
jealous Puritan; and the catastrophe arises from a mistake, not
very probably produced, by marrying a woman in a mask.&nbsp; Yet
this gay comedy, when all these deductions are made, will still
remain the work of very powerful and fertile faculties; the
dialogue is quick and sparkling, the incidents such as seize the
attention, and the wit so exuberant that it
&ldquo;o&rsquo;er-informs its tenement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next year he gave another specimen of his abilities in <i>The
Double Dealer</i>, which was not received with equal
kindness.&nbsp; He writes to his patron the Lord Halifax a
dedication, in which he endeavours to reconcile the reader to
that which found few friends among the audience.&nbsp; These
apologies are always useless: <i>de gestibus non est
disputandem</i>.&nbsp; Men may be convinced, but they cannot be
pleased, against their will.&nbsp; But though taste is obstinate,
it is very variable, and time often prevails when arguments have
failed.&nbsp; Queen Mary conferred upon both those plays the
honour of her presence; and when she died soon after, Congreve
testified his gratitude by a despicable effusion of elegiac
pastoral, a composition in which all is unnatural and yet nothing
is new.</p>
<p>In another year (1695) his prolific pen produced <i>Love for
Love</i>, a comedy of nearer alliance to life, and exhibiting
more real manners, than either of the former.&nbsp; The character
of Foresight was then common.&nbsp; Dryden calculated nativities;
both Cromwell and King William had their lucky days; and
Shaftesbury himself, though he had no religion, was said to
regard predictions.&nbsp; The Sailor is not accounted very
natural, but he is very pleasant.&nbsp; With this play was opened
the New Theatre, under the direction of Betterton, the tragedian,
where he exhibited two years afterwards (1687) <i>The Mourning
Bride</i>, a tragedy, so written as to show him sufficiently
qualified for either kind of dramatic poetry.&nbsp; In this play,
of which, when he afterwards revised it, he reduced the
versification to greater regularity; there is more bustle than
sentiment; the plot is busy and intricate, and the events take
hold on the attention; but, except a very few passages, we are
rather amused with noise and perplexed with stratagem, than
entertained with any true delineation of natural
characters.&nbsp; This, however, was received with more
benevolence than any other of his works, and still continues to
be acted and applauded.</p>
<p>But whatever objections may be made either to his comic or
tragic excellence, they are lost at once in the blaze of
admiration, when it is remembered that he had produced these four
plays before he had passed his twenty-fifth year, before other
men, even such as are some time to shine in eminence, have passed
their probation of literature, or presume to hope for any other
notice than such as is bestowed on diligence and inquiry.&nbsp;
Among all the efforts of early genius, which literary history
records, I doubt whether any one can be produced that more
surpasses the common limits of nature than the plays of
Congreve.</p>
<p>About this time began the long-continued controversy between
Collier and the poets.&nbsp; In the reign of Charles I. the
Puritans had raised a violent clamour against the drama, which
they considered as an entertainment not lawful to Christians, an
opinion held by them in common with the Church of Rome; and
Prynne published &ldquo;Histriomastix,&rdquo; a huge volume in
which stage-plays were censured.&nbsp; The outrages and crimes of
the Puritans brought afterwards their whole system of doctrine
into disrepute, and from the Restoration the poets and players
were left at quiet; for to have molested them would have had the
appearance of tendency to puritanical malignity.&nbsp; This
danger, however, was worn away by time, and Collier, a fierce and
implacable non-juror, knew that an attack upon the theatre would
never make him suspected for a Puritan; he therefore (1698)
published &ldquo;A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness
of the English Stage,&rdquo; I believe with no other motive than
religious zeal and honest indignation.&nbsp; He was formed for a
controvertist, with sufficient learning, with diction vehement
and pointed, though often vulgar and incorrect, with
unconquerable pertinacity, with wit in the highest degree and
sarcastic, and with all those powers exalted and invigorated by
just confidence in his cause.&nbsp; Thus qualified and thus
incited, he walked out to battle, and assailed at once most of
the living writers, from Dryden to Durfey.&nbsp; His onset was
violent; those passages, which, while they stood single, had
passed with little notice, when they were accumulated and exposed
together, excited horror.&nbsp; The wise and the pious caught the
alarm, and the nation wondered why it had so long suffered
irreligion and licentiousness to be openly taught at the public
charge.</p>
<p>Nothing now remained for the poets but to resist or fly.&nbsp;
Dryden&rsquo;s conscience or his prudence, angry as he was,
withheld him from the conflict.&nbsp; Congreve and Vanbrugh
attempted answers.&nbsp; Congreve, a very young man, elated with
success, and impatient of censure, assumed an air of confidence
and security.&nbsp; His chief art of controversy is to retort
upon his adversary his own words: he is very angry, and hoping to
conquer Collier with his own weapons, allows himself in the use
of every term of contumely and contempt, but he has the sword
without the arm of Scanderbeg; he has his antagonist&rsquo;s
coarseness but not his strength.&nbsp; Collier replied, for
contest was his delight.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was not to be frighted
from his purpose or his prey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cause of Congreve was not tenable; whatever glosses he
might use for the defence or palliation of single passages, the
general tenour and tendency of his plays must always be
condemned.&nbsp; It is acknowledged, with universal conviction,
that the perusal of his works will make no man better, and that
their ultimate effect is to represent pleasure in alliance with
vice, and to relax those obligations by which life ought to be
regulated.</p>
<p>The stage found other advocates, and the dispute was
protracted through ten years: but at last comedy grew more
modest, and Collier lived to see the reformation of the
theatre.</p>
<p>Of the powers by which this important victory was achieved, a
quotation from <i>Love for Love</i>, and the remark upon it, may
afford a specimen:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Sir Samps</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sampson&rsquo;s a very good
name; for your Sampsons were strong dogs from the
beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Angel</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have a care&mdash;if you remember,
the strongest Sampson of your name pulled an old house over his
head at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you have the sacred history burlesqued, and
Sampson once more brought into the house of Dagon, to make sport
for the Philistines!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Congreve&rsquo;s last play was <i>The Way of The World</i>,
which, though, as he hints in him dedication it was written with
great labour and much thought, was received with so little
favour, that being in a high degree offended and disgusted, he
resolved to commit his quiet and his fame no more to the caprices
of an audience.</p>
<p>From this time his life ceased to be public; he lived for
himself and his friends, and among his friends was able to name
every man of his time whom wit and elegance had raised to
reputation.&nbsp; It may be therefore reasonably supposed that
his manners were polite, and his conversation pleasing.&nbsp; He
seems not to have taken much pleasure in writing, as he
contributed nothing to the <i>Spectator</i>, and only one paper
to the <i>Tatler</i>, though published by men with whom he might
be supposed willing to associate: and though he lived many years
after the publication of his &ldquo;Miscellaneous Poems,&rdquo;
yet he added nothing to them, but lived on in literary indolence,
engaged in no controversy, contending with no rival, neither
soliciting flattery by public commendations, nor provoking enmity
by malignant criticism, but passing his time among the great and
splendid, in the placid enjoyment of his fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Having owed his fortune to Halifax, he continued, always of
his patron&rsquo;s party, but, as it seems, without violence or
acrimony, and his firmness was naturally esteemed, as his
abilities were reverenced.&nbsp; His security therefore was never
violated; and when, upon the extrusion of the Whigs, some
intercession was used lest Congreve should be displaced, the Earl
of Oxford made this answer:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Non obtusa adeo gestamus pectora
P&oelig;ni,<br />
Nec tam aversus equos Tyri&acirc; sol jungit ab urbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He that was thus honoured by the adverse party might naturally
expect to be advanced when his friends returned to power, and he
was accordingly made secretary for the island of Jamaica, a
place, I suppose without trust or care, but which, with his post
in the Customs, is said to have afforded him twelve hundred
pounds a year.&nbsp; His honours were yet far greater than his
profits.&nbsp; Every writer mentioned him with respect, and among
other testimonies to his merit, Steele made him the patron of his
&ldquo;Miscellany,&rdquo; and Pope inscribed to him his
translations of the &ldquo;Iliad.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he treated the
muses with ingratitude; for, having long conversed familiarly
with the great, he wished to be considered rather as a man of
fashion than of wit; and, when he received a visit from Voltaire,
disgusted him by the despicable foppery of desiring to be
considered not as an author but a gentleman; to which the
Frenchman replied, &ldquo;that, if he had been only a gentleman,
he should not have come to visit him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his retirement he may be supposed to have applied himself
to books, for he discovers more literature than the poets have
commonly attained.&nbsp; But his studies were in his later days
obstructed by cataracts in his eyes, which at last terminated in
blindness.&nbsp; This melancholy state was aggravated by the
gout, for which he sought relief by a journey to Bath: but, being
overturned in his chariot, complained from that time of a pain in
his side, and died at his house in Surrey Street in the Strand,
January 29, 1728&ndash;9.&nbsp; Having lain in state in the
Jerusalem Chamber, he was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a
monument is erected to his memory by Henrietta Duchess of
Marlborough, to whom, for reasons either not known or not
mentioned, he bequeathed a legacy of about ten thousand pounds,
the accumulation of attentive parsimony, which, though to her
superfluous and useless, might have given great assistance to the
ancient family from which he descended, at that time, by the
imprudence of his relation, reduced to difficulties and
distress.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Congreve</span> has merit of the highest
kind; he is an original writer, who borrowed neither the models
of his plot nor the manner of his dialogue.&nbsp; Of his plays I
cannot speak distinctly, for since I inspected them many years
have passed, but what remains upon my memory is, that his
characters are commonly fictitious and artificial, with very
little of nature, and not much of life.&nbsp; He formed a
peculiar idea of comic excellence, which he supposed to consist
in gay remarks and unexpected answers; but that which he
endeavoured, he seldom failed of performing.&nbsp; His scenes
exhibit not much of humour, imagery, or passion: his personages
are a kind of intellectual gladiators; every sentence is to ward
or strike; the contest of smartness is never intermitted; his wit
is a meteor playing to and fro with alternate coruscations.&nbsp;
His comedies have, therefore, in some degree, the operation of
tragedies, they surprise rather than divert, and raise admiration
oftener than merriment.&nbsp; But they are the works of a mind
replete with images, and quick in combination.</p>
<p>Of his miscellaneous poetry I cannot say anything very
favourable.&nbsp; The powers of Congreve seem to desert him when
he leaves the stage, as Ant&aelig;us was no longer strong than
when he could touch the ground.&nbsp; It cannot be observed
without wonder, that a mind so vigorous and fertile in dramatic
compositions should on any other occasion discover nothing but
impotence and poverty.&nbsp; He has in these little pieces
neither elevation of fancy, selection of language, nor skill in
versification: yet, if I were required to select from the whole
mass of English poetry the most poetical paragraph, I know not
what I could prefer to an exclamation in the &ldquo;Mourning
Bride&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">ALMERIA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a fancied noise; for all is
hushed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">LEONORA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bore the accent of a human voice.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">ALMERIA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thy fear, or else some transient
wind<br />
Whistling through hollows of this vaulted isle:<br />
We&rsquo;ll listen&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">LEONORA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">ALMERIA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, all is hushed and still as
death.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis dreadful!<br />
How reverend is the face of this tall pile,<br />
Whose ancient pillars rear their marble heads,<br />
To bear aloft its arched and ponderous roof,<br />
By its own weight made steadfast and immovable,<br />
Looking tranquillity!&nbsp; It strikes an awe<br />
And terror on my aching sight; the tombs<br />
And monumental caves of death look cold,<br />
And shoot a chillness to my trembling heart.<br />
Give use thy hand, and let me hear thy voice;<br />
Nay, quickly speak to me, and let me hear<br />
Thy voice&mdash;my own affrights me with its echoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He who reads these lines enjoys for a moment the powers of a
poet; he feels what he remembers to have felt before, but he
feels it with great increase of sensibility; he recognises a
familiar image, but meets it again amplified and expanded,
embellished with beauty and enlarged with majesty.&nbsp; Yet
could the author, who appears here to have enjoyed the confidence
of Nature, lament the death of Queen Mary in lines like
these:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The rocks are cleft, and new-descending
rills<br />
Furrow the brows of all the impending hills.<br />
The water-gods to floods their rivulets turn,<br />
And each, with streaming eyes, supplies his wanting urn.<br />
The fauns forsake the woods, the nymphs the grove,<br />
And round the plain in sad distractions rove:<br />
In prickly brakes their tender limbs they tear,<br />
And leave on thorns their locks of golden hair.<br />
With their sharp nails, themselves the satyrs wound,<br />
And tug their shaggy beards, and bite with grief the ground.<br
/>
Lo Pan himself, beneath a blasted oak,<br />
Dejected lies, his pipe in pieces broke<br />
See Pales weeping too in wild despair,<br />
And to the piercing winds her bosses bare.<br />
And see yon fading myrtle, where appears<br />
The Queen of Love, all bathed in flowing tears;<br />
See how she wrings her hands, and beats her breast,<br />
And tears her useless girdle from her waist:<br />
Hear the sad murmurs of her sighing doves!<br />
For grief they sigh, forgetful of their loves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And many years after he gave no proof that time had improved
his wisdom or his wit, for, on the death of the Marquis of
Blandford, this was his song:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And now the winds, which had so long
been still,<br />
Began the swelling air with sighs to fill;<br />
The water-nymphs, who motionless remained<br />
Like images of ice, while she complained,<br />
Now loosed their streams; as when descending rains<br />
Roll the steep torrents headlong o&rsquo;er the plains.<br />
The prone creation who so long had gazed<br />
Charmed with her cries, and at her griefs amazed,<br />
Began to roar and howl with horrid yell,<br />
Dismal to hear, and terrible to tell!<br />
Nothing but groans and sighs were heard around,<br />
And echo multiplied each mournful sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In both these funeral poems, when he has <i>yelled</i> out
many <i>syllables</i> of senseless <i>dolour</i>, he dismisses
his reader with senseless consolation.&nbsp; From the grave of
Pastora rises a light that forms a star, and where Amaryllis wept
for Amyntas from every tear sprung up a violet.&nbsp; But William
is his hero, and of William he will sing:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The hovering winds on downy wings shall
wait around,<br />
And catch, and waft to foreign lands, the flying
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cannot but be proper to show what they shall have to catch
and carry:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas now, when flowery lawns the
prospect made,<br />
And flowing brooks beneath a forest shade,<br />
A lowing heifer, loveliest of the herd,<br />
Stood feeding by; while two fierce bulls prepared<br />
Their arm&eacute;d heads for light, by fate of war to prove<br />
The victor worthy of the fair one&rsquo;s love;<br />
Unthought presage of what met next my view;<br />
For soon the shady scene withdrew.<br />
And now, for woods, and fields, and springing flowers,<br />
Behold a town arise, bulwarked with walls and lofty towers;<br />
Two rival armies all the plain o&rsquo;erspread,<br />
Each in battalia ranged, and shining arms arrayed<br />
With eagle eyes beholding both from far,<br />
Namur, the price and mistress of the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Birth of the Muse&rdquo; is a miserable
fiction.&nbsp; One good line it has which was borrowed from
Dryden.&nbsp; The concluding verses are these:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;This said, no more remained.&nbsp; The
ethereal host<br />
Again impatient crowd the crystal coast.<br />
The father now, within his spacious hands,<br />
Encompassed all the mingled mass of seas and lands;<br />
And, having heaved aloft the ponderous sphere,<br />
He launched the world to float in ambient air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of his irregular poems, that to Mrs. Arabella Hunt seems to be
the best; his Ode for St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day, however, had some
lines which Pope had in his mind when he wrote his own.&nbsp; His
imitations of Horace are feebly paraphrastical, and the additions
which he makes are of little value.&nbsp; He sometimes retains
what were more properly omitted, as when he talks of
<i>vervain</i> and <i>gums</i> to propitiate Venus.</p>
<p>Of his Translations, the &ldquo;Satire of Juvenal&rdquo; was
written very early, and may therefore be forgiven, though it had
not the massiness and vigour of the original.&nbsp; In all his
versions strength and sprightliness are wanting; his &ldquo;Hymn
to Venus,&rdquo; from Homer, is perhaps the best.&nbsp; His lines
are weakened with expletives, and his rhymes are frequently
imperfect.&nbsp; His petty poems are seldom worth the cost of
criticism; sometimes the thoughts are false and sometimes
common.&nbsp; In his verses on Lady Gethin, the latter part is in
imitation of Dryden&rsquo;s ode on Mrs. Killigrew; and
&ldquo;Doris,&rdquo; that has been so lavishly flattered by
Steele, has indeed some lively stanzas, but the expression might
be mended, and the most striking part of the character had been
already shown in &ldquo;Love for Love.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Art of Pleasing&rdquo; is founded on a vulgar, but perhaps
impracticable principle, and the staleness of the sense is not
concealed by any novelty of illustration or elegance of
diction.&nbsp; This tissue of poetry, from which he seems to have
hoped a lasting name, is totally neglected, and known only as it
is appended to his plays.</p>
<p>While comedy or while tragedy is regarded, his plays are
likely to be read; but, except what relates to the stage, I know
not that he has ever written a stanza that is sung, or a couplet
that is quoted.&nbsp; The general character of his
&ldquo;Miscellanies&rdquo; is that they show little wit and
little virtue.&nbsp; Yet to him it must be confessed that we are
indebted for the connection of a national error, and for the cure
of our Pindaric madness.&nbsp; He first taught the English
writers that Pindar&rsquo;s odes were regular; and though
certainly he had not the lire requisite for the higher species of
lyric poetry, he has shown us that enthusiasm has its rules, and
that in mere confusion there is neither grace nor greatness.</p>
<h2>BLACKMORE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Richard Blackmore</span> is one of
those men whose writings have attracted much notice, but of whose
life and manners very little has been communicated, and whose lot
it has been to be much oftener mentioned by enemies than by
friends.&nbsp; He was the son of Robert Blackmore, of Corsham in
Wiltshire, styled by Wood <i>Gentleman</i>, and supposed to have
been an attorney, having been for some time educated in a country
school, he was at thirteen sent to Westminster, and in 1668 was
entered at Edmund Hall in Oxford, where he took the degree of MA.
June 8, 1676, and resided thirteen years, a much longer time than
is usual to spend at the university, and which he seems to have
passed with very little attention to the business of the place;
for, in his poems, the ancient names of nations or places, which
he often introduces, are pronounced by chance.&nbsp; He
afterwards travelled.&nbsp; At Padua he was made doctor of
physic, and, after having wandered about a year and a half on the
Continent, returned home.</p>
<p>In some part of his life, it is not known when, his indigence
compelled him to teach a school, a humiliation with which, though
it certainly lasted but a little while, his enemies did not
forget to reproach him, when he became conspicuous enough to
excite malevolence; and let it be remembered for his honour, that
to have been once a schoolmaster is the only reproach which all
the perspicacity of malice, animated by wit, has ever fixed upon
his private life.</p>
<p>When he first engaged in the study of physic, he inquired, as
he says, of Dr. Sydenham, what authors he should read and was
directed by Sydenham to &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo;:
&ldquo;which&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a very good book; I read
it still.&rdquo;&nbsp; The perverseness of mankind makes it often
mischievous to men of eminence to give way to merriment; the idle
and the illiterate will long shelter themselves under this
foolish apophthegm.&nbsp; Whether he rested satisfied with this
direction, or sought for better, he commenced physician, and
obtained high eminence and extensive practice.&nbsp; He became
Fellow of the College of Physicians, April 12, 1687, being one of
the thirty which, by the new charter of King James, were added to
the former fellows.&nbsp; His residence was in Cheapside, and his
friends were chiefly in the City.&nbsp; In the early part of
Blackmore&rsquo;s time a citizen was a term of reproach; and his
place of abode was another topic, to which his adversaries had
recourse in the penury of scandal.</p>
<p>Blackmore, therefore, was made a poet not by necessity but
inclination, and wrote not for a livelihood but for fame; or, if
he may tell his own motives, for a nobler purpose, to engage
poetry in the cause of virtue.</p>
<p>I believe it is peculiar to him that his first public work was
an heroic poem.&nbsp; He was not known as a maker of verses till
he published (in 1695) &ldquo;Prince Arthur,&rdquo; in ten books,
written, as he relates, &ldquo;by such catches and starts, and in
such occasional uncertain hours as his profession afforded, and
for the greatest part in coffee-houses, or in passing up and down
the streets.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the latter part of this apology he
was accused of writing &ldquo;to the rumbling of his chariot
wheels.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had read, he says, &ldquo;but little
poetry throughout his whole life; and for fifteen years before
had not written a hundred verses except one copy of Latin verses
in praise of a friend&rsquo;s book.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thinks, and
with some reason, that from such a performance perfection cannot
be expected; but he finds another reason for the severity of his
censurers, which he expresses in language such as Cheapside
easily furnished.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not free of the Poet&rsquo;s
Company, having never kissed the governor&rsquo;s hands: mine is
therefore not so much as a permission poem, but a downright
interloper.&nbsp; Those gentlemen, who carry on their poetical
trade in a joint stock, would certainly do what they could to
sink and ruin an unlicensed adventurer, notwithstanding I
disturbed none of their factories, nor imported any goods they
have ever dealt in.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had lived in the City till he
had learned its note.</p>
<p>That &ldquo;Prince Arthur&rdquo; found many readers is
certain; for in two years it had three editions, a very uncommon
instance of favourable reception, at a time when literary
curiosity was yet confined to particular classes of the
nation.&nbsp; Such success naturally raised animosity; and Dennis
attacked it by a formal criticism, more tedious and disgusting
than the work which he condemns.&nbsp; To this censure may be
opposed the approbation of Locke, and the admiration of Molyneux,
which are found in their printed &ldquo;Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Molyneux is particularly delighted with the song of Mopas, which
is therefore subjoined to this narrative.</p>
<p>It is remarked by Pope, that &ldquo;what raises the hero,
often sinks the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Blackmore is may be said
that, as the poet sinks, the man rises; the animadversions of
Dennis, insolent and contemptuous as they were, raised in him no
implacable resentment; he and his critic were afterwards friends;
and in one of his latter works he praises Dennis &ldquo;as equal
to Boileau in poetry, and superior to him in critical
abilities.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seems to have been more delighted with
praise than pained by censure, and instead of slackening,
quickened his career.&nbsp; Having in two years produced ten
books of &ldquo;Prince Arthur,&rdquo; in two years more (1697) he
sent into the world &ldquo;King Arthur&rdquo; in twelve.&nbsp;
The provocation was now doubled, and the resentment of wits and
critics may be supposed to have increased in proportion.&nbsp; He
found, however, advantages more than equivalent to all their
outrages.&nbsp; He was this year made one of the physicians in
ordinary to King William, and advanced by him to the honour of
knighthood, with the present of a gold chaise and medal.&nbsp;
The malignity of the wits attributed his knighthood to his new
poem, but King William was not very studious of poetry; and
Blackmore perhaps had other merit, for he says in his dedication
to &ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo; that &ldquo;he had a greater part in the
succession of the house of Hanover than ever he had
boasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Blackmore could contribute to the Succession, or what he
imagined himself to have contributed, cannot now be known.&nbsp;
That he had been of considerable use, I doubt not but he
believed, for I hold him to have been very honest; but he might
easily make a false estimate of his own importance.&nbsp; Those
whom their virtue restrains from deceiving others, are often
disposed by their vanity to deceive themselves.&nbsp; Whether he
promoted the Succession or not, he at least approved it, and
adhered invariably to his principles and party through his whole
life.</p>
<p>His ardour of poetry still continued; and not long after
(1700) he published a &ldquo;Paraphrase on the Book of Job, and
other parts of the Scripture.&rdquo;&nbsp; This performance
Dryden, who pursued him with great malignity, lived long enough
to ridicule in a Prologue.</p>
<p>The wits easily confederated against him, as Dryden, whose
favour they almost all courted, was his professed
adversary.&nbsp; He had, besides, given them reason for
resentment, as, in his preface to &ldquo;Prince Arthur,&rdquo; he
had said of the dramatic writers almost all that was alleged
afterwards by Collier; but Blackmore&rsquo;s censure was cold and
general, Collier&rsquo;s was personal and ardent; Blackmore
taught his reader to dislike what Collier incited him to
abhor.</p>
<p>In his preface to &ldquo;King Arthur&rdquo; he endeavoured to
gain at least one friend, and propitiated Congreve by higher
praise of his &ldquo;Mourning Bride&rdquo; than it has obtained
from any other critic.</p>
<p>The same year he published a &ldquo;Satire on Wit,&rdquo; a
proclamation of defiance which united the poets almost all
against him, and which brought upon him lampoons and ridicule
from every side.&nbsp; This he doubtless foresaw, and evidently
despised; nor should his dignity of mind be without its praise,
had he not paid the homage to greatness which he denied to
genius, and degraded himself by conferring that authority over
the national taste, which he takes from the poets, upon men of
high rank and wide influence, but of less wit and not greater
virtue.</p>
<p>Here is again discovered the inhabitant of Cheapside, whose
head cannot keep his poetry unmingled with trade.&nbsp; To hinder
that intellectual bankruptcy which he affects to fear he will
erect a &ldquo;Bank for Wit.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this poem he justly
censured Dryden&rsquo;s impurities, but praised his powers,
though in a subsequent edition he retained the satire, and
omitted the praise.&nbsp; What was his reason, I know not; Dryden
was then no longer in his way.&nbsp; His head still teemed with
heroic poetry; and (1705) he published &ldquo;Eliza,&rdquo; in
ten books.&nbsp; I am afraid that the world was now weary of
contending about Blackmore&rsquo;s heroes, for I do not remember
that by any author, serious or comical, I have found
&ldquo;Eliza&rdquo; either praised or blamed.</p>
<p>She &ldquo;dropped,&rdquo; as it seems, &ldquo;dead-born from
the press.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is never mentioned, and was never seen
by me till I borrowed it for the present occasion.&nbsp; Jacob
says &ldquo;it is corrected and revised from another
impression,&rdquo; but the labour of revision was thrown
away.</p>
<p>From this time he turned some of his thoughts to the
celebration of living characters, and wrote a poem on the Kit-Cat
Club, and &ldquo;Advice to the Poets how to celebrate the Duke of
Marlborough&rdquo; but on occasion of another year of success,
thinking himself qualified to give more instruction, he again
wrote a poem of &ldquo;Advice to a Weaver of
Tapestry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Steele was then publishing the
<i>Tatler</i>, and, looking round him for something at which he
might laugh, unluckily alighted on Sir Richard&rsquo;s work, and
treated it with such contempt that, as Fenton observes, he put an
end to that species of writers that gave advice to painters.</p>
<p>Not long after (1712) he published &ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; a
philosophical poem, which has been, by my recommendation,
inserted in the late collection.&nbsp; Whoever judges of this by
any other of Blackmore&rsquo;s performances will do it
injury.&nbsp; The praise given it by Addison (<i>Spectator</i>,
339) is too well known to be transcribed; but some notice is due
to the testimony of Dennis, who calls it a &ldquo;philosophical
poem, which has equalled that of &lsquo;Lucretius&rsquo; in the
beauty of its versification, and infinitely surpassed it in the
solidity and strength of its reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why an author surpasses himself it is natural to
inquire.&nbsp; I have heard from Mr. Draper, an eminent
bookseller, an account received by him from Ambrose Philips,
&ldquo;That Blackmore, as he proceeded in this poem, laid his
manuscript from time to time before a club of wits with whom he
associated, and that every man contributed, as he could, either
improvement or correction; so that,&rdquo; said Philips,
&ldquo;there are perhaps nowhere in the book thirty lines
together that now stand as they were originally
written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The relation of Philips, I suppose, was true; but when all
reasonable, all credible allowance is made for this friendly
revision, the author will still retain an ample dividend of
praise; for to him must always be assigned the plan of the work,
the distribution of its parts, the choice of topics, the train of
argument, and, what is yet more, the general predominance of
philosophical judgment and poetical spirit.&nbsp; Correction
seldom effects more than the suppression of faults: a happy line,
or a single elegance, may perhaps be added; but of a large work,
the general character must always remain.&nbsp; The original
constitution can be very little helped by local remedies;
inherent and radical dulness will never be much invigorated by
intrinsic animation.&nbsp; This poem, if he had written nothing
else, would have transmitted him to posterity among the first
favourites of the English muse; but to make verses was his
transcendent pleasure, and, as he was not deterred by censure, he
was not satiated with praise.&nbsp; He deviated, however,
sometimes into other tracks of literature, and condescended to
entertain his readers with plain prose.&nbsp; When the
<i>Spectator</i> stopped, he considered the polite world as
destitute of entertainment, and in concert with Mr. Hughes, who
wrote every third paper, published three times a week the
&ldquo;Lay Monastery,&rdquo; founded on the supposition that some
literary men, whose characters are described, had retired to a
house in the country to enjoy philosophical leisure, and resolved
to instruct the public by communicating their disquisitions and
amusements.&nbsp; Whether any real persons were concealed under
fictitious names is not known.&nbsp; The hero of the club is one
Mr. Johnson, such a constellation of excellence, that his
character shall not be suppressed, though there is no great
genius in the design nor skill in the delineation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first I shall name is Mr. Johnson, a gentleman that
owes to nature excellent faculties and an elevated genius, and to
industry and application many acquired accomplishments.&nbsp; His
taste is distinguishing, just, and delicate; his judgment clear,
and his reason strong, accompanied with an imagination full of
spirit, of great compass, and stored with refined ideas.&nbsp; He
is a critic of the first rank and, what is his peculiar ornament,
he is delivered from the ostentation, malevolence, and
supercilious temper, that so often blemish men of that
character.&nbsp; His remarks result from the nature and reason of
things, and are formed by a judgment free and unbiassed by the
authority of those who have lazily followed each other in the
same beaten track of thinking, and are arrived only at the
reputation of acute grammarians and commentators; men who have
been copying one another many hundred years without any
improvement, or, if they have ventured farther, have only applied
in a mechanical manner the rules of ancient critics to modern
writings, and with great labour discovered nothing but their own
want of judgment and capacity.&nbsp; As Mr. Johnson penetrates to
the bottom of his subject, by which means his observations are
solid and natural, as well as delicate, so his design is always
to bring to light something useful and ornamental; whence his
character is the reverse to theirs, who have eminent abilities in
insignificant knowledge, and a great felicity in finding out
trifles.&nbsp; He is no less industrious to search out the merit
of an author, than sagacious in discerning his errors and
defects, and takes more pleasure in commending the beauties than
exposing the blemishes of a laudable writing.&nbsp; Like Horace,
in a long work he can bear some deformities, and justly lay them
on the imperfection of human nature, which is incapable of
faultless productions.&nbsp; When an excellent drama appears in
public, and by its intrinsic worth attracts a general applause,
he is not stung with envy and spleen; nor does he express a
savage nature in fastening upon the celebrated author, dwelling
upon his imaginary defects, and passing over his conspicuous
excellences.&nbsp; He treats all writers upon the same impartial
foot, and is not, like the little critics, taken up entirely in
finding out only the beauties of the ancient and nothing but the
errors of the modern writers.&nbsp; Never did any one express
more kindness and good-nature to young and unfinished authors, he
promotes their interests, protects their reputation, extenuates
their faults, and sets off their virtues, and by his candour
guards them from the severity of his judgment.&nbsp; He is not
like those dry critics who are morose because they cannot write
themselves, but is himself master of a good vein in poetry; and
though he does not often employ it, yet he has sometimes
entertained his friends with his unpublished
performances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the lay monks seem to be but feeble mortals an
comparison with the gigantic Johnson, who yet, with all his
abilities and the help of the fraternity, could drive the
publication but to forty papers, which were afterwards collected
into a volume, and called in the title &ldquo;A Sequel to the
<i>Spectators</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some years afterwards (1716 and 1717) he published two volumes
of essays in prose, which can be commended only as they are
written for the highest and noblest purpose&mdash;the promotion
of religion.&nbsp; Blackmore&rsquo;s prose is not the prose of a
poet, for it is languid, sluggish, and lifeless; his diction is
neither daring nor exact, his flow neither rapid nor easy, and
his periods neither smooth nest strong.&nbsp; His account of
<i>wit</i> will show with how little clearness he is content to
think, and how little his thoughts are recommended by his
language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to its efficient cause, <i>wit</i> owes its
production to an extraordinary and peculiar temperament in the
constitution of the possessor of it, in which is found a
concurrence of regular and exalted ferments, and an affluence of
animal spirits, refined and rectified to a great degree of
purity; whence, being endowed with vivacity, brightness, and
celerity, as well in their reflections as direct motions, they
become proper instruments for the sprightly operations of the
mind, by which means the imagination can with great facility
range the wide field of Nature, contemplate an infinite variety
of objects, and, by observing the similitude and disagreement of
their several qualities, single out and abstract, and then suit
and unite, those ideas which will best serve its purpose.&nbsp;
Hence beautiful allusions, surprising metaphors, and admirable
sentiments, are always ready at hand; and while the fancy is full
of images, collected from innumerable objects, and their
different qualities, relations, and habitudes, it can at pleasure
dress a common notion in a strange but becoming garb, by which,
as before observed, the same thought will appear a new one, to
the great delight and wonder of the hearer.&nbsp; What we call
<i>genius</i> results from this particular happy complexion in
the first formation of the person that enjoys it, and is
Nature&rsquo;s gift, but diversified by various specific
characters and limitations, as its active fire is blended and
allayed by different proportions of phlegm, or reduced and
regulated by the contrast of opposite ferments.&nbsp; Therefore,
as there happens in the composition of facetious genius a greater
or less, though still an inferior, degree of judgment and
prudence, one man of wit will be varied and distinguished from
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these essays he took little care to propitiate the wits,
for he scorns to avert their malice at the expense of virtue or
of truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several, in their books, have many sarcastical and
spiteful strokes at religion in general; while others make
themselves pleasant with the principles of the Christian.&nbsp;
Of the last kind this age has seen a most audacious example in
the book entitled &lsquo;A Tale of a Tub.&rsquo;&nbsp; Had this
writing been published in a pagan or popish nation, who are
justly impatient of all indignity offered to the established
religion of their country, no doubt but the author would have
received the punishment he deserved.&nbsp; But the fate of this
impious buffoon is very different, for in a Protestant kingdom,
zealous of their civil and religious immunities, he has not only
escaped affronts and the effects of public resentment, but has
been caressed and patronised by persons of great figure, and of
all denominations.&nbsp; Violent party-men, who differed in all
things besides, agreed in their turn to show particular respect
and friendship to this insolent derider of the worship of his
country, till at last the reputed writer is not only gone off
with impunity, but triumphs in his dignity and preferment.&nbsp;
I do not know that any inquiry or search was ever made after this
writing, or that any reward was ever offered for the discovery of
the author, or that the infamous book was ever condemned to be
burnt in public.&nbsp; Whether this proceeds from the excessive
esteem and love that men in power, during the late reign, had for
wit, or their defect of zeal and concern for the Christian
religion will be determined best by those who are best acquainted
with their character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another place he speaks with becoming abhorrence of a
<i>godless author</i> who has burlesqued a Psalm.&nbsp; This
author was supposed to be Pope, who published a reward for any
one that would produce the coiner of the accusation, but never
denied it, and was afterwards the perpetual and incessant enemy
of Blackmore.</p>
<p>One of his essays is upon the spleen, which is treated by him
so much to his own satisfaction, that he has published the same
thoughts in the same words; first, in the &ldquo;Lay
Monastery,&rdquo; then in the &ldquo;Essay,&rdquo; and then in
the &ldquo;Preface to a Medical Treatise on the
Spleen.&rdquo;&nbsp; One passage, which I have found already
twice, I will here exhibit, because I think it better imagined
and better expressed than could be expected from the common tenor
of his prose:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;As the several combinations of
splenetic madness and folly produce an infinite variety of
irregular under-standing, so the amicable accommodation and
alliance between several virtues and vices produce an equal
diversity in the dispositions and manners of mankind; whence it
comes to pass, that as many monstrous and absurd productions are
found in the moral as in the intellectual world.&nbsp; How
surprising is it to observe among the least culpable men, some
whose minds are attracted by heaven and earth with a seeming
equal force; some who are proud of humility; others who are
censorious and uncharitable, yet self-denying and devout; some
who join contempt of the world with sordid avarice; and others,
who preserve a great degree of piety with ill-nature and
ungoverned passions.&nbsp; Nor are instances of this inconsistent
mixture less frequent among bad men, where we often with
admiration see persons at once generous and unjust, impious
lovers of their country, and flagitious heroes, good-natured
sharpers, immoral men of honour, and libertines who will sooner
die than change their religion; and though it is true that
repugnant coalitions of so high a degree are found but in a part
of mankind, yet none of the whole mass, either good or bad, are
entirely exempted from some absurd mixture.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He about this time (August 22, 1716) became one of the elects
of the College of Physicians, and was soon after (October 1)
chosen Censor.&nbsp; He seems to have arrived late, whatever was
the reason, at his medical honours.</p>
<p>Having succeeded so well in his book on Creation, by which he
established the great principle of all religion, he thought his
undertaking imperfect, unless he likewise enforced the truth of
Revelation, and for that purpose added another poem on
&ldquo;Redemption.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had likewise written before
his &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; three books on the Nature of Man.</p>
<p>The lovers of musical devotion have always wished for a more
happy metrical version than they have yet obtained of the Book of
Psalms.&nbsp; This wish the piety of Blackmore led him to
gratify, and he produced (1721) &ldquo;A New Version of the
Psalms of David fitted to the Tunes used in Churches,&rdquo;
which being recommended by the archbishops and many bishops,
obtained a license for its admission into public worship; but no
admission has it yet obtained, nor has it any right to come where
Brady and Tate have got possession.&nbsp; Blackmore&rsquo;s name
must be added to those of many others who, by the same attempt,
have obtained only the praise of meaning well.</p>
<p>He was not yet deterred from heroic poetry.&nbsp; There was
another monarch of this island (for he did not fetch his heroes
from foreign countries) whom he considered as worthy the epic
muse, and he dignified &ldquo;Alfred&rdquo; (1723) with twelve
books.&nbsp; But the opinion of the nation was now settled; a
hero introduced by Blackmore was not likely to find either
respect or kindness; &ldquo;Alfred&rdquo; took his place by
&ldquo;Eliza&rdquo; in silence and darkness.&nbsp; Benevolence
was ashamed to favour, and malice was weary of insulting.&nbsp;
Of his four epic poems, the first had such reputation and
popularity as enraged the critics; the second was at least known
enough to be ridiculed; the two last had neither friends nor
enemies.</p>
<p>Contempt is a kind of gangrene, which, if it seizes one part
of a character, corrupts all the rest by degrees.&nbsp; Blackmore
being despised as a poet, was in time neglected as a physician;
his practice, which was once invidiously great, forsook him in
the latter part of his life, but being by nature, or by
principle, averse from idleness, he employed his unwelcome
leisure in writing books on physic, and teaching others to cure
those whom he could himself cure no longer.&nbsp; I know not
whether I can enumerate all the treatises by which he has
endeavoured to diffuse the art of healing, for there is scarcely
any distemper of dreadful name which he has not taught the reader
how to oppose.&nbsp; He has written on the small-pox, with a
vehement invective against inoculation; on consumption, the
spleen, the gout, the rheumatism, the king&rsquo;s evil, the
dropsy, the jaundice, the stone, the diabetes, and the
plague.&nbsp; Of those books, if I had read them, it could nor be
expected that I should be able to give a critical account.&nbsp;
I have been told that there is something in them of vexation and
discontent, discovered by a perpetual attempt to degrade physic
from its sublimity, and to represent it as attainable without
much previous or concomitant learning.&nbsp; By the transient
glances which I have thrown upon them I have observed an affected
contempt of the ancients, and a supercilious derision of
transmitted knowledge.&nbsp; Of this indecent arrogance the
following quotation from his preface to the &ldquo;Treatise on
the Small-pox&rdquo; will afford a specimen, in which, when the
reader finds what I fear is true, that, when he was censuring
Hippocrates, he did not know the difference between
<i>aphorism</i> and <i>apophthegm</i>, he will not pay much
regard to his determinations concerning ancient learning.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As for this book of aphorisms, it is like
my Lord Bacon&rsquo;s of the same title, a book of jests, or a
grave collection of trite and trifling observations; of which,
though many are true and certain, yet they signify nothing, and
may afford diversion, but no instruction, most of them being much
inferior to the sayings of the wise men of Greece, which yet are
so low and mean, that we are entertained every day with more
valuable sentiments at the table conversation of ingenious and
learned men.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am unwilling, however, to leave him in total disgrace, and
will therefore quote from another preface a passage less
reprehensible.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some gentlemen have been disingenuous and
unjust to me, by wresting and forcing my meaning, in the preface
to another book, as if I condemned and exposed all learning,
though they knew I declared that I greatly honoured and esteemed
all men of superior literature and erudition, and that I only
undervalued false or superficial learning, that signifies nothing
for the service of mankind; and that as to physic, I expressly
affirmed that learning must be joined with native genius to make
a physician of the first rank; but if those talents are
separated, I asserted, and do still insist, that a man of native
sagacity and diligence will prove a more able and useful
practiser than a heavy notional scholar, encumbered with a heap
of confused ideas.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was not only a poet and a physician, but produced likewise
a work of a different kind, &ldquo;A True and Impartial History
of the Conspiracy against King William of Glorious Memory in the
Year 1695.&rdquo;&nbsp; This I have never seen, but suppose it is
at least compiled with integrity.&nbsp; He engaged likewise in
theological controversy, and wrote two books against the Arians:
&ldquo;Just Prejudices against the Arian Hypothesis,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Modern Arians Unmasked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another of his works
is &ldquo;Natural Theology; or, Moral Duties considered apart
from Positive; with some Observations on the Desirableness and
Necessity of a Supernatural Revelation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the
last book that he published.&nbsp; He left behind him &ldquo;The
Accomplished Preacher; or, an Essay upon Divine Eloquence,&rdquo;
which was printed after his death by Mr. White of Nayland, in
Essex, the minister who attended his death-bed, and testified the
fervent piety of his last hours.&nbsp; He died on the 8th of
October, 1729.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Blackmore, by the unremitted enmity of the wits, whom he
provoked more by his virtue than his dulness, has been exposed to
worse treatment than he deserved.&nbsp; His name was so long used
to point every epigram upon dull writers, that it became at last
a byword of contempt but it deserves observation, that malignity
takes hold only of his writings, and that his life passed without
reproach, even when his boldness of reprehension naturally turned
upon him many eyes desirous to espy faults which many tongues
would have made haste to publish.&nbsp; But those who could not
blame, could, at least, forbear to praise, and therefore of his
private life and domestic character there are no memorials.</p>
<p>As an author, he may justly claim the honours of
magnanimity.&nbsp; The incessant attacks of his enemies, whether
serious or merry, are never discovered to have disturbed his
quiet, or to have lessened his confidence in himself: they
neither awed him to silence nor to caution: they neither provoked
him to petulance, nor depressed him to complaint.&nbsp; While the
distributors of literary fame were endeavouring to depreciate and
degrade him, he either despised or defied them, wrote on as he
had written before, and never turned aside to quiet them by
civility, or repress them by confutation.&nbsp; He depended with
great security on his own powers, and perhaps was for that reason
less diligent in perusing books.&nbsp; His literature was, I
think, but small.&nbsp; What he knew of antiquity, I suspect him
to have gathered from modern compilers; but, though he could not
boast of much critical knowledge, his mind was stored with
general principles, and he left minute researches to those whom
he considered as little minds.&nbsp; With this disposition he
wrote most of his poems.&nbsp; Having formed a magnificent
design, he was careless of particular and subordinate elegances;
he studied no niceties of versification; he waited for no
felicities of fancy, but caught his first thoughts in the first
words in which they were presented; nor does it appear that he
saw beyond his own performances, or had ever elevated his was to
that ideal perfection which every genius born to excel is
condemned always to pursue, and never overtake.&nbsp; In the
first suggestions of his imagination he acquiesced; he thought
them good, and did not seek for better.&nbsp; His works may be
read a long time without the occurrence of a single line that
stands prominent from the rest.&nbsp; The poem on
&ldquo;Creation&rdquo; has, however, the appearance of more
circumspection; it wants neither harmony of numbers, accuracy of
thought, nor elegance of diction.&nbsp; It has either been
written with great care, or, what cannot be imagined of so long a
work, with such felicity as made care less necessary.&nbsp; Its
two constituent parts are ratiocination and description.&nbsp; To
reason in verse is allowed to be difficult; but Blackmore not
only reasons in verse, but very often reasons poetically; and
finds the art of uniting ornament with strength and ease with
closeness.&nbsp; This is a skill which Pope might have
condescended to learn from him, when he needed it so much in his
&ldquo;Moral Essays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his descriptions both of life and nature, the poet and the
philosopher happily co-operate; truth is recommended by elegance,
and elegance sustained by truth.&nbsp; In the structure and order
of the poem, not only the greater parts are properly consecutive,
but the didactic and illustrative paragraphs are so happily
mingled, that labour is relieved by pleasure, and the attention
is led on through a long succession of varied excellence to the
original position, the fundamental principle of wisdom and of
virtue.</p>
<p>As the heroic poems of Blackmore are now little read, it is
thought proper to insert, as a specimen from &ldquo;Prince
Arthur,&rdquo; the song of Mopas mentioned by
Molyneux:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But that which Arthur
with most pleasure heard<br />
Were noble strains, by Mopas sung the bard,<br />
Who to his harp in lofty verse began,<br />
And through the secret maze of Nature ran.<br />
He the Great Spirit sung, that all things filled,<br />
That the tumultuous waves of Chaos stilled;<br />
Whose nod disposed the jarring seeds to peace,<br />
And made the wars of hostile Atoms cease.<br />
All Beings, we in fruitful Nature find,<br />
Proceeded from the Great Eternal mind:<br />
Streams of his unexhausted spring of power,<br />
And, cherished with his influence, endure.<br />
He spread the pure cerulean fields on high,<br />
And arched the chambers of the vaulted sky,<br />
Which he, to suit their glory with their height,<br />
Adorned with globes, that reel, as drunk with light.<br />
His hand directed all the tuneful spheres,<br />
He turned their orbs, and polished all the stars.<br />
He filled the Sun&rsquo;s vast lamp with golden light:<br />
And bid the silver Moon adorn the night.<br />
He spread the airy Ocean without shores,<br />
Where birds are wafted with their feathered oars.<br />
Then sung the bard how the light vapours rise<br />
From the warm earth, and cloud the smiling skies;<br />
He sung how some, chilled in their airy flight,<br />
Fall scattered down in pearly dew by night;<br />
How some, raised higher, sit in secret steams<br />
On the reflected points of bounding beams,<br />
Till, chilled with cold, they shade th&rsquo; ethereal plain,<br
/>
Then on the thirsty earth descend in rain;<br />
How some, whose parts a slight contexture show,<br />
Sink hovering through the air in fleecy snow;<br />
How part is spun in silken threads, and clings<br />
Entangled in the grass is gluey strings;<br />
How others stamp to stones, with rushing sound<br />
Fall from their crystal quarries to the ground;<br />
How some are laid in trains, that kindled fly,<br />
In harmless fires by night, about the sky;<br />
How some in winds blow with impetuous force,<br />
And carry ruin where they bend their course,<br />
While some conspire to form a gentle breeze,<br />
To fan the air, and play among the trees;<br />
How some, enraged, grow turbulent and loud,<br />
Pent in the bowels of a frowning cloud,<br />
That cracks, as if the axis of the world<br />
Was broke, and Heaven&rsquo;s bright towers were downwards
hurled.<br />
He sung how earth&rsquo;s wide ball, at Jove&rsquo;s command,<br
/>
Did in the midst on airy columns stand;<br />
And how the soul of plants, in prison held,<br />
And bound with sluggish fetters, lies concealed,<br />
Till with the spring&rsquo;s warm beams, almost released<br />
From the dull weight, with which it lay opprest,<br />
Its vigour spreads, and makes the teeming earth<br />
Heave up, and labour with the sprouting birth:<br />
The active spirit freedom seeks in vain,<br />
It only works and twists a stronger chain;<br />
Urging its prison&rsquo;s sides to break a way,<br />
It makes that wider, where &rsquo;tis forced to stay:<br />
Till, having formed its living house, it rears<br />
Its head, and in a tender plant appears.<br />
Hence springs the oak, the beauty of the grove,<br />
Whose stately trunk fierce storms can scarcely move.<br />
Hence grows the cedar, hence the swelling vine<br />
Does round the elm its purple clusters twine.<br />
Hence painted flowers the smiling gardens bless,<br />
Both with their fragrant scent and gaudy dress.<br />
Hence the white lily in full beauty grows,<br />
Hence the blue violet and blushing rose.<br />
He sung how sunbeams brood upon the earth,<br />
And in the glebe hatch such a numerous birth;<br />
Which way the genial warmth in Summer storms<br />
Turns putrid vapours to a bed of worms;<br />
How rain, transformed by this prolific power,<br />
Falls from the clouds an animated shower.<br />
He sung the embryo&rsquo;s growth within the womb,<br />
And how the parts their various shapes assume.<br />
With what rare art the wondrous structure&rsquo;s wrought,<br />
From one crude mass to such perfection brought;<br />
That no part useless, none misplaced we see,<br />
None are forgot, and more would monstrous be.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>POPE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Pope</span> was born in London,
May 22, 1688, of parents whose rank or station was never
ascertained: we are informed that they were of &ldquo;gentle
blood;&rdquo; that his father was of a family of which the Earl
of Downe was the head, and that his mother was the daughter of
William Turner, Esquire, of York, who had likewise three sons,
one of whom had the honour of being killed, and the other of
dying, in the service of Charles the First; the third was made a
general officer in Spain, from whom the sister inherited what
sequestrations and forfeitures had left in the family.&nbsp;
This, and this only, is told by Pope, who is more willing, as I
have heard observed, to show what his father was not, than what
he was.&nbsp; It is allowed that he grew rich by trade; but
whether in a shop or on the Exchange was never discovered till
Mr. Tyers told, on the authority of Mrs. Racket, that he was a
linendraper in the Strand.&nbsp; Both parents were Papists.</p>
<p>Pope was from his birth of a constitution tender and delicate,
but is said to have shown remarkable gentleness and sweetness of
disposition.&nbsp; The weakness of his body continued through his
life, but the mildness of his mind perhaps ended with his
childhood.&nbsp; His voice when he was young was so pleasing,
that he was called in fondness &ldquo;The Little
Nightingale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being not sent early to school, he was taught to read by an
aunt; and, when he was seven or eight years old, became a lover
of books.&nbsp; He first learned to write by imitating printed
books, a species of penmanship in which he retained great
excellence through his whole life, though his ordinary hand was
not elegant.&nbsp; When he was about eight he was placed in
Hampshire, under Taverner, a Romish priest, who, by a method very
rarely practised, taught him the Greek and Latin rudiments
together.&nbsp; He was now first regularly initiated in poetry by
the perusal of &ldquo;Ogilby&rsquo;s Homer&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Sandys&rsquo; Ovid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ogilby&rsquo;s assistance
he never repaid with any praise; but of Sandys he declared, in
his notes to the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; that English poetry owed
much of its beauty to his translations.&nbsp; Sandys very rarely
attempted original composition.</p>
<p>From the care of Taverner, under whom his proficiency was
considerable, he was removed to a school at Twyford, near
Winchester, and again to another school about Hyde Park Corner,
from which he used sometimes to stroll to the play-hones, and was
so delighted with theatrical exhibitions, that he formed a kind
of play from &ldquo;Ogilby&rsquo;s Iliad,&rdquo; with some verses
of his own intermixed, which he persuaded his schoolfellows to
act, with the addition of his master&rsquo;s gardener, who
personated Ajax.</p>
<p>At the two last schools he used to represent himself as having
lost part of what Taverner had taught him, and on his master at
Twyford he had already exercised his poetry in a lampoon.&nbsp;
Yet under those masters he translated more than a fourth part of
the &ldquo;Metamorphoses.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he kept the same
proportion in his other exercises, it cannot be thought that his
loss was great.&nbsp; He tells of himself, in his poems, that
&ldquo;he lisped in numbers;&rdquo; and used to say that he could
not remember the time when he began to make verses.&nbsp; In the
style of fiction, it might have been said of him, as of Pindar,
that when he lay in his cradle &ldquo;the bees swarmed about his
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the time of the Revolution his father, who was
undoubtedly disappointed by the sudden blast of Popish
prosperity, quitted his trade, and retired to Binfield, in
Windsor Forest, with about twenty thousand pounds, for which,
being conscientiously determined not to entrust it to the
Government, he found no better use than that of locking it up in
a chest, and taking from it what his expenses required; and his
life was long enough to consume a great part of it before his son
came to the inheritance.</p>
<p>To Binfield Pope was called by his father when he was about
twelve years old, and there he had for a few months the
assistance of one Deane, another priest, of whom he learned only
to construe a little of &ldquo;Tully&rsquo;s
Offices.&rdquo;&nbsp; How Mr. Deane could spend with a boy who
had translated so much of &ldquo;Ovid&rdquo; some months over a
small part of &ldquo;Tully&rsquo;s Offices,&rdquo; it is now vain
to inquire.&nbsp; Of a youth so successfully employed, and so
conspicuously improved, a minute account must be naturally
desired; but curiosity must be contented with confused,
imperfect, and sometimes improbable intelligence.&nbsp; Pope,
finding little advantage from external help, resolved
thenceforward to direct himself, and at twelve formed a plan of
study, which he completed with little other incitement than the
desire of excellence.&nbsp; His primary and principal purpose was
to be a poet, with which his father accidentally concurred by
proposing subjects and obliging him to correct his performances
by many revisals, after which the old gentleman, when he was
satisfied, would say, &ldquo;These are good rhymes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In his perusal of the English poets he soon distinguished the
versification of Dryden, which he considered as the model to be
studied, and was impressed with such veneration for his
instructor, that he persuaded some friends to take him to the
coffee-house which Dryden frequented, and pleased himself with
having seen him.</p>
<p>Dryden died May 1, 1701, some days before Pope was twelve; so
early must he therefore have felt the power of harmony, and the
zeal of genius.&nbsp; Who does not wish that Dryden could have
known the value of the homage that was paid him, and foreseen the
greatness of his young admirer?</p>
<p>The earliest of Pope&rsquo;s productions is his &ldquo;Ode on
Solitude,&rdquo; written before he was twelve, in which there is
nothing more than other forward boys have attained, and which is
not equal to Cowley&rsquo;s performance at the same age.&nbsp;
His time was now wholly spent in reading and writing.&nbsp; As he
read the classics he amused himself with translating them, and at
fourteen made a version of the first book of the
&ldquo;Thebais,&rdquo; which, with some revision, he afterwards
published.&nbsp; He must have been at this time, if he had no
help, a considerable proficient in the Latin tongue.</p>
<p>By Dryden&rsquo;s fables, which had then been not long
published, and were much in the hands of poetical readers, he was
tempted to try his own skill in giving Chaucer a more fashionable
appearance, and put &ldquo;January and May&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Prologue of the Wife of Bath&rdquo; into modern
English.&nbsp; He translated likewise the Epistle of
&ldquo;Sappho to Phaon&rdquo; from Ovid, to complete the version,
which was before imperfect, and wrote some other small pieces,
which he afterwards printed.&nbsp; He sometimes imitated the
English poets, and professed to have written at fourteen his poem
upon &ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; after Rochester&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had now formed his versification,
and the smoothness of his numbers surpassed his original; but
this is a small part of his praise; he discovers such
acquaintance both with human life and public affairs as is not
easily conceived to have been attainable by a boy of fourteen in
Windsor Forest.</p>
<p>Next year he was desirous of opening to himself new sources of
knowledge, by making himself acquainted with modern languages,
and removed for a time to London, that he might study French and
Italian, which, as he desired nothing more than to read them,
were by diligent application soon despatched.&nbsp; Of Italian
learning he does not appear to have ever made much use in his
subsequent studies.&nbsp; He then returned to Binfield, and
delighted himself with his own poetry.&nbsp; He tried all styles,
and many subjects.&nbsp; He wrote a comedy, a tragedy, an epic
poem, with panegyrics on all the princes of Europe; and, as he
confesses, &ldquo;thought himself the greatest genius that ever
was.&rdquo;&nbsp; Self-confidence is the first requisite to great
undertakings.&nbsp; He, indeed, who forms his opinion of himself
in solitude, without knowing the powers of other men, is very
liable to error; but it was the felicity of Pope to rate himself
at his real value.&nbsp; Most of his puerile productions were, by
his maturer judgment, afterwards destroyed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alcander,&rdquo; the epic poem, was burnt by the
persuasion of Atterbury.&nbsp; The tragedy was founded on the
legend of St. Genevieve.&nbsp; Of the comedy there is no
account.&nbsp; Concerning his studies, it is related that he
translated &ldquo;Tully on Old Age,&rdquo; and that, besides his
books of poetry and criticisms, he read &ldquo;Temple&rsquo;s
Essays&rdquo; and &ldquo;Locke on Human
Understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp; His reading, though his favourite
authors are not known, appears to have been sufficiently
extensive and multifarious, for his early pieces show with
sufficient evidence his knowledge of books.&nbsp; He that is
pleased with himself easily imagines that he shall please
others.&nbsp; Sir William Trumbull, who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and Secretary of State, when he retired from
business, fixed his residence in the neighbourhood of
Binfield.&nbsp; Pope, not yet sixteen, was introduced to the
statesman of sixty, and so distinguished himself that their
interviews ended in friendship and correspondence.&nbsp; Pope
was, through his whole life, ambitious of splendid acquaintance;
and he seems to have wanted neither diligence nor success in
attracting the notice of the great, for, from his first entrance
into the world, and his entrance was very early, he was admitted
to familiarity with those whose rank or station made them most
conspicuous.</p>
<p>From the age of sixteen the life of Pope, as an author, may be
properly computed.&nbsp; He now wrote his pastorals, which were
shown to the poets and critics of that time.&nbsp; As they well
deserved, they were read with admiration, and many praises were
bestowed upon them and upon the preface, which is both elegant
and learned in a high degree; they were, however, not published
till five years afterwards.</p>
<p>Cowley, Milton, and Pope are distinguished among the English
poets by the early exertion of their powers, but the works of
Cowley alone were published in his childhood, and, therefore, of
him only can it be certain that his puerile performances received
no improvement from his maturer studies.</p>
<p>At this time began his acquaintance with Wycherley, a man who
seems to have had among his contemporaries his full share of
reputation, to have been esteemed without virtue, and caressed
without good humour.&nbsp; Pope was proud of his notice.&nbsp;
Wycherley wrote verses in his praise, which he was charged by
Dennis with writing to himself, and they agreed for a while to
flatter one another.&nbsp; It is pleasant to remark how soon Pope
learned the cant of an author, and began to treat critics with
contempt, though he had yet suffered nothing from them.&nbsp; But
the fondness of Wycherley was too violent to last.&nbsp; His
esteem of Pope was such that he submitted some poems to his
revision, and when Pope, perhaps proud of such confidence, was
sufficiently bold in his criticisms, and liberal in his
alterations, the old scribbler was angry to see his pages
defaced, and felt more pain from the detection than content from
the amendment of his faults.&nbsp; They parted, but Pope always
considered him with kindness, and visited him a little time
before he died.&nbsp; Another of his early correspondents was Mr.
Cromwell, of whom I have learned nothing particular, but that he
used to ride a-hunting in a tie-wig.&nbsp; He was fond, and
perhaps vain, of amusing himself with poetry and criticism, and
sometimes sent his performances to Pope, who did not forbear such
remarks as were now and then unwelcome.&nbsp; Pope, in his turn,
put the juvenile version of &ldquo;Statius&rdquo; into his hands
for correction.&nbsp; Their correspondence afforded the public
its first knowledge of Pope&rsquo;s epistolary powers, for his
letters were given by Cromwell to one Mrs. Thomas, and she many
years afterwards sold them to Curll, who inserted them in a
volume of his &ldquo;Miscellanies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walsh, a name yet preserved among the minor poets, was one of
his first encouragers.&nbsp; His regard was gained by the
pastorals, and from him Pope received the counsel from which he
seems to have regulated his studies.&nbsp; Walsh advised him to
correctness, which, as he told him, the English poets had
hitherto neglected, and which, therefore, was left to him as a
basis of fame; and, being delighted with rural poems, recommended
to him to write a pastoral comedy, like those which are read so
eagerly in Italy, a design which Pope probably did not approve,
as he did not follow it.</p>
<p>Pope had now declared himself a poet, and, thinking himself
entitled to poetical conversation, began at seventeen to frequent
Will&rsquo;s, a coffee-house on the north side of Russell Street,
in Covent Garden, where the wits of that time used to assemble,
and where Dryden had, when he lived, been accustomed to
preside.&nbsp; During this period of his life he was
indefatigably diligent and insatiably curious, wanting health for
violent and money for expensive pleasures, and having excited in
himself very strong desires of intellectual eminence, he spent
much of his time over his books; but he read only to store his
mind with facts and images, seizing all that his authors
presented with undistinguishing voracity, and with an appetite
for knowledge too eager to be nice.&nbsp; In a mind like his,
however, all the faculties were at once involuntarily
improving.&nbsp; Judgment is forced upon us by experience.&nbsp;
He that reads many books must compare one opinion or one style
with another; and, when he compares, must necessarily
distinguish, reject, and prefer.&nbsp; But the account given by
himself of his studies was, that from fourteen to twenty he read
only for amusement, from twenty to twenty-seven for improvement
and instruction; that in the first part of his time he desired
only to know, and in the second he endeavoured to judge.</p>
<p>The Pastorals, which had been for some time handed about among
poets and critics, were at last printed (1709) in Tonson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Miscellany,&rdquo; in a volume which began with the
Pastorals of Philips, and ended with those of Pope.&nbsp; The
same year was written the &ldquo;Essay on Criticism,&rdquo; a
work which displays such extent of comprehension, such nicety of
distinction, such acquaintance with mankind, and such knowledge
both of ancient and modern learning, as are not often attained by
the maturest age and longest experience.&nbsp; It was published
about two years afterwards, and, being praised by Addison in the
<i>Spectator</i>, with sufficient liberality, met with so much
favour as enraged Dennis, &ldquo;who,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;found himself attacked, without any manner of provocation
on his side, and attacked in his person instead of his writings,
by one who was wholly a stranger to him, at a time when all the
world knew he was persecuted by fortune; and not only saw that
this was attempted in a clandestine manner, with the utmost
falsehood and calumny, but found that all this was done by a
little, affected hypocrite, who had nothing in his mouth at the
same time but truth, candour, friendship, good-nature, humanity,
and magnanimity.&rdquo;&nbsp; How the attack was clandestine is
not easily perceived, nor how his person is depreciated; but he
seems to have known something of Pope&rsquo;s character, in whom
may be discovered an appetite to talk too frequently of his own
virtues.&nbsp; The pamphlet is such as rage might be expected to
dictate.&nbsp; He supposes himself to be asked two questions;
whether the essay will succeed, and who or what is the
author.</p>
<p>Its success he admits to be secured by the false opinions then
prevalent; the author he concludes to be &ldquo;young and
raw.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First, because he discovers a sufficiency
beyond his little ability, and hath rashly undertaken a task
infinitely above his force.&nbsp; Secondly, while this little
author struts and affects the dictatorian air, he plainly shows
that at the same time he is under the rod: and, while he pretends
to give laws to others, is a pedantic slave to authority and
opinion.&nbsp; Thirdly, he hath, like schoolboys, borrowed both
from living and dead.&nbsp; Fourthly, he knows not his own mind,
and frequently contradicts himself.&nbsp; Fifthly, he is almost
perpetually in the wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these positions he attempts to prove by quotations and
remarks; but his desire to do mischief is greater than his
power.&nbsp; He has, however, justly criticised some passages in
these lines:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;There are whom Heaven has blessed with
store of wit,<br />
Yet want as much again to manage it:<br />
For wit and judgment ever are at strife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is apparent that wit has two meanings, and that what is
wanted, though called wit, is truly judgment.&nbsp; So far Dennis
is undoubtedly right: but not content with argument, he will have
a little mirth, and triumphs over the first couplet in terms too
elegant to be forgotten.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the way, what rare
numbers are here!&nbsp; Would not one swear that this youngster
had espoused some antiquated muse, who had sued out a divorce on
account of impotence, from some superannuated sinner; and, having
been p&mdash;d by her former spouse, has got the gout in her
decrepit age, which makes her hobble so damnably?&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was the man who would reform a nation sinking into
barbarity.</p>
<p>In another place Pope himself allowed that Dennis had detected
one of those blunders which are called &ldquo;bulls.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The first edition had this line:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What is this wit&mdash;<br />
Where wanted scorned; and envied where acquired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; says the critic, &ldquo;can wit be scorned
where it is not?&nbsp; Is not this a figure frequently employed
in Hibernian land!&nbsp; The person that wants this wit may
indeed be scorned, but the scorn shows the honour which the
contemner has for wit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this remark Pope made the
proper use, by correcting the passage.</p>
<p>I have preserved, I think, all that is reasonable in
Dennis&rsquo;s criticism; it remains that justice be done to his
delicacy.&nbsp; &ldquo;For his acquaintance,&rdquo; says Dennis,
&ldquo;he names Mr. Walsh, who had by no means the qualification
which this author reckons absolutely necessary to a critic, it
being very certain that he was, like this essayer a very
indifferent poet; he loved to be well dressed; and I remember a
little young gentleman whom Mr. Walsh used to take into his
company as a double foil to his person and capacity.&nbsp;
Inquire between Sunning Hill and Oakingham, for a young, short,
equal, gentleman, the very bow of the God of Love, and tell me
whether he be a proper author to make personal reflections?&nbsp;
He may extol the ancients, but he has reason to thank the gods
that he was born a modern; for had he been born of Grecian
parents, and his father consequently had by law had the absolute
disposal of him, his life had been no longer than that of one of
his poems, the life of half a day.&nbsp; Let the person of a
gentleman of his parts be never so contemptible, his inward man
is ten times more ridiculous; it being impossible that his
outward form, though it be that of downright monkey, should
differ so much from human shape as his unthinking, immaterial
part does from human understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus began the
hostility between Pope and Dennis, which, though it was suspended
for a short time, never was appeased.&nbsp; Pope seems, at first,
to have attacked him wantonly; but though he always professed to
despise him, he discovers, by mentioning him very often, that he
felt his force or his venom.</p>
<p>Of this essay, Pope declared that he did not expect the sale
to be quick, because &ldquo;not one gentleman in sixty, even of
liberal education, could understand it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
gentleman, and the education of that time, seem to have been of a
lower character than they are of this.&nbsp; He mentioned a
thousand copies as a numerous impression.</p>
<p>Dennis was not his only censurer; the zealous Papists thought
the monks treated with too much contempt, and Erasmus too
studiously praised; but to these objections he had not much
regard.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Essay,&rdquo; has been translated into French by
Hamilton, author of the &ldquo;Comte de Grammont,&rdquo; whose
version was never printed, by Robotham, secretary to the king for
Hanover, and by Resnel; and commented by Dr. Warburton, who has
discovered in it such order and connection as was not perceived
by Addison, nor, as it is said, intended by the author.</p>
<p>Almost every poem, consisting of precepts, is so far arbitrary
and immethodical, that many of the paragraphs may change places
with no apparent inconvenience; for of two or more positions,
depending upon some remote and general principle, there is seldom
any cogent reason why one should precede the other.&nbsp; But for
the order in which they stand, whatever it be, a little ingenuity
may easily give a reason.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo;
says Hooker, &ldquo;that, by long circumduction, from any one
truth all truth may be inferred.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of all homogeneous
truths, at least of all truths respecting the same general end,
in whatever series they may be produced, a concatenation by
intermediate ideas may be formed, such as, when it is once shown,
shall appear natural; but if this order be reversed, another mode
of connection equally spacious may be found or made.&nbsp;
Aristotle is praised for naming fortitude first of the cardinal
virtues, as that without which no other virtue can steadily be
practised; but he might, with equal propriety, have placed
prudence and justice before it; since without prudence fortitude
is mad; without justice, it is mischievous.&nbsp; As the end of
method is perspicuity, that series is sufficiently regular that
avoids obscurity; and where there is no obscurity, it will not be
difficult to discover method.</p>
<p>In the <i>Spectator</i> was published the
&ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; which he first submitted to the perusal of
Steele, and corrected in compliance with his criticisms.&nbsp; It
is reasonable to infer from his &ldquo;Letters&rdquo; that the
verses on the &ldquo;Unfortunate Lady&rdquo; were written about
the time when his &ldquo;Essay&rdquo; was published.&nbsp; The
lady&rsquo;s name and adventures I have sought with fruitless
inquiry.&nbsp; I can therefore tell no more than I have learned
from Mr. Ruffhead, who writes with the confidence of one who
could trust his information.&nbsp; She was a woman of eminent
rank and large fortune, the ward of an uncle, who, having given
her a proper education, expected, like other guardians, that she
should make at least an equal match; and such he proposed to her,
but found it rejected in favour of a young gentleman of inferior
condition.&nbsp; Having discovered the correspondence between the
two lovers, and finding the young lady determined to abide by her
own choice, he supposed that separation might do what can rarely
be done by arguments, and sent her into a foreign country, where
she was obliged to converse only with those from whom her uncle
had nothing to fear.&nbsp; Her lover took care to repeat his
vows; but his letters were intercepted and carried to her
guardian, who directed her to be watched with still greater
vigilance, till of this restraint she grow so impatient that she
bribed a woman servant to procure her a sword, which she directed
to her heart.</p>
<p>From this account, given with evident intention to raise the
lady&rsquo;s character, it does not appear that she had any claim
to praise nor much to compassion.&nbsp; She seems to have been
impatient, violent, and ungovernable.&nbsp; Her uncle&rsquo;s
power could not have lasted long; the hour of liberty and choice
would have come in time.&nbsp; But her desires were too hot for
delay, and she liked self-murder better than suspense.&nbsp; Nor
is it discovered that the uncle, whoever he was, is with much
justice delivered to posterity as &ldquo;a false
guardian.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seems to have done only that for which
a guardian is appointed; he endeavoured to direct his niece till
she should be able to direct herself.&nbsp; Poetry has not often
been worse employed than in dignifying the amorous fiery of a
raving girl.</p>
<p>Not long after he wrote the &ldquo;Rape of the Lock,&rdquo;
the most airy, the most ingenious, and the most delightful off
all his compositions, occasioned by a frolic of gallantry, rather
too familiar, in which Lord Petre cut off a lock of Mrs. Arabella
Fermor&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp; This, whether stealth or violence, was
so much resented that the commerce of the two families, before
very friendly, was interrupted.&nbsp; Mr. Caryl, a gentleman who,
being secretary to King James&rsquo;s queen, had followed his
mistress into France, and who, being the author of <i>Sir Solomon
Single</i>, a comedy, and some translations, was entitled to the
notice of a wit, solicited Pope to endeavour a reconciliation by
a ludicrous poem which might bring both the parties to a better
temper.&nbsp; In compliance with Caryl&rsquo;s request, though
his name was for a long time marked only by the first and last
letter, &ldquo;C&mdash;l,&rdquo; a poem of two cantos, was
written (1711), as is said, in a fortnight, and sent to the
offended lady, who liked it well enough to show it; and, with the
usual process of literary transactions, the author, dreading a
surreptitious edition, was forced to publish it.</p>
<p>The event is said to have been such as was desired, the
pacification and diversion of all to whom it related, except Sir
George Brown, who complained with some bitterness that, in the
character of Sir Plume, he was made to talk nonsense.&nbsp;
Whether all this be true I have some doubt; for at Paris, a few
years ago, a niece of Mrs. Fermor, who presided in an English
convent, mentioned Pope&rsquo;s work with very little gratitude,
rather as an insult than an honour; and she may be supposed to
have inherited the opinion of her family.&nbsp; At its first
appearance at was termed by Addison &ldquo;merum
sal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pope, however, saw that it was capable of
improvement; and, having luckily contrived to borrow his
machinery from the Rosicrucians, imparted the scheme with which
his head was teeming to Addison, who told him that his work, as
it stood, was &ldquo;a delicious little thing,&rdquo; and gave
him no encouragement to retouch it.</p>
<p>This has been too hastily considered as an instance of
Addison&rsquo;s jealousy, for, as he could not guess the conduct
of the new design, or the possibilities of pleasure comprised in
a fiction of which there had been no examples, he might very
reasonably and kindly persuade the author to acquiesce in his own
prosperity, and forbear an attempt which he considered as an
unnecessary hazard.&nbsp; Addison&rsquo;s counsel was happily
rejected.&nbsp; Pope foresaw the future efflorescence of imagery
then budding in his mind, and resolved to spare no art or
industry of cultivation.&nbsp; The soft luxuriance of his fancy
was already shooting, and all the gay varieties of diction were
ready at his hand to colour and embellish it.&nbsp; His attempt
was justified by its success.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Rape of the
Lock&rdquo; stands forward, in the classes of literature, as the
most exquisite example of ludicrous poetry.&nbsp; Berkeley
congratulated him upon the display of powers more truly poetical
than he had shown before with elegance of description and
justness of precepts he had now exhibited boundless fertility of
invention.&nbsp; He always considered the intermixture of the
machinery with the action as his most successful exertion of
poetical art.&nbsp; He, indeed, could never afterwards produce
anything of such unexampled excellence.&nbsp; Those performances,
which strike with wonder, are combinations of skilful genius with
happy casualty; and it is not likely that any felicity, like the
discovery of a new race of preternatural agents, should happen
twice to the same man.&nbsp; Of this poem the author was, I
think, allowed to enjoy the praise for a long time without
disturbance.&nbsp; Many years afterwards Dennis published some
remarks upon it with very little force and with no effect; for
the opinion of the public was already settled, and it was no
longer at the mercy of criticism.</p>
<p>About this time he published the &ldquo;Temple of Fame,&rdquo;
which, as he tells Steele in their correspondence, he had written
two years before&mdash;that is, when he was only twenty-two years
old, an early time of life for so much learning and so much
observation as that work exhibits.&nbsp; On this poem Dennis
afterwards published some remarks, of which the most reasonable
is that some of the lines represent motion as exhibited by
sculpture.</p>
<p>Of the Epistle from &ldquo;Eloisa to Abelard,&rdquo; I do not
know the date.&nbsp; His first inclination to attempt a
composition of that tender kind arose, as Mr. Savage told me,
from his perusal of Prior&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nut-brown
Maid.&rdquo;&nbsp; How much he has surpassed Prior&rsquo;s work
it is not necessary to mention, when perhaps it may be said, with
justice, that he has excelled every composition of the same
kind.&nbsp; The mixture of religious hope and resignation gives
an elevation and dignity to disappointed love, which images
merely natural cannot bestow.&nbsp; The gloom of a convent
strikes the imagination with far greater force than the solitude
of a grove.&nbsp; This piece was, however, not much his favourite
in his later years, though I never heard upon what principle he
slighted it.</p>
<p>In the next year (1713) he published &ldquo;Windsor
Forest,&rdquo; of which part was, as he relates, written at
sixteen, about the same time as his Pastorals, and the latter
part was added afterwards.&nbsp; Where the addition begins we are
not told.&nbsp; The lines relating to the peace confess their own
date.&nbsp; It is dedicated to Lord Lansdowne, who was then in
high reputation and influence among the Tories; and it is said
that the conclusion of the poem gave great pain to Addison, both
as a poet and a politician.&nbsp; Reports like this are often
spread with boldness very disproportionate to their
evidence.&nbsp; Why should Addison receive any particular
disturbance from the last lines of &ldquo;Windsor
Forest&rdquo;?&nbsp; If contrariety of opinion could poison a
politician, he could not live a day; and, as a poet, he must have
felt Pope&rsquo;s force of genius much more from many other parts
of his works.&nbsp; The pain that Addison might feel it is not
likely that he would confess; and it is certain that he so well
suppressed his discontent that Pope now thought himself his
favourite, for, having been consulted in the revisal of
&ldquo;Cato&rdquo; he introduced it by a prologue; and, when
Dennis published his remarks, undertook, not indeed to vindicate,
but to revenge his friend, by a &ldquo;Narrative of the Frenzy of
John Dennis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that Addison gave no encouragement
to this disingenuous hostility, for, says Pope, in a letter to
him, &ldquo;indeed your opinion, that &rsquo;tis entirely to be
neglected, would be my own in my own case; but I felt more warmth
here than I did when I first saw his book against myself (though,
indeed, in two minutes it made me heartily merry).&rdquo;&nbsp;
Addison was not a man on whom such cant of sensibility could make
much impression.&nbsp; He left the pamphlet to itself, having
disowned it to Dennis, and perhaps did not think Pope to have
deserved much by his officiousness.</p>
<p>This year was printed in the <i>Guardian</i> the ironical
comparison between the pastorals of Philips and Pope, a
composition of artifice, criticism, and literature, to which
nothing equal will easily be found.&nbsp; The superiority of Pope
is so ingeniously dissembled, and the feeble lines of Philips so
skilfully preferred, that Steele, being deceived, was unwilling
to print the paper, lest Pope should be offended.&nbsp; Addison
immediately saw the writer&rsquo;s design, and, as it seems, had
malice enough to conceal his discovery, and to permit a
publication which, by making his friend Philips ridiculous, made
him for ever an enemy to Pope.</p>
<p>It appears that about this time Pope had a strong inclination
to unite the art of painting with that of poetry, and put himself
under the tuition of Jervas.&nbsp; He was near-sighted, and
therefore not formed by nature for a painter; he tried, however,
how far he could advance, and sometimes persuaded his friends to
sit.&nbsp; A picture of Betterton, supposed to be drawn by him,
was in the possession of Lord Mansfield.&nbsp; If this was taken
from the life, he must have begun to paint earlier, for Betterton
was now dead.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s ambition of this new art
produced some encomiastic verses to Jervas, which certainly show
his power as a poet; but I have been told that they betray his
ignorance of painting.&nbsp; He appears to have regarded
Betterton with kindness and esteem, and after his death
published, under his name, a version into modern English of
Chaucer&rsquo;s Prologues and one of his Tales, which, as was
related by Mr. Harte, were believed to have been the performance
of Pope himself by Fenton, who made him a gay offer of five
pounds if he would show them in the hand of Betterton.</p>
<p>The next year (1713) produced a bolder attempt, by which
profit was sought as well as praise.&nbsp; The poems which he had
hitherto written, however they might have diffused his name, had
made very little addition to his fortune.&nbsp; The allowance
which his father made him, though, proportioned to what he had,
it might be liberal, could not be large; his religion hindered
him from the occupation of any civil employment; and he
complained that he wanted even money to buy books.&nbsp; He
therefore resolved to try how far the favour of the public
extended by soliciting a subscription to a version of the
&ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; with large notes.&nbsp; To print by
subscription was, for some time, a practice peculiar to the
English.&nbsp; The first considerable work for which this
expedient was employed is said to have been Dryden&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Virgil,&rdquo; and it had been tried again with great
success when the <i>Tatlers</i> were collected into volumes.</p>
<p>There was reason to believe that Pope&rsquo;s attempt would be
successful.&nbsp; He was in the full bloom of reputation and was
personally known to almost all whom dignity of employment or
splendour of reputation had made eminent; he conversed
indifferently with both parties, and never disturbed the public
with his political opinions; and it might be naturally expected,
as each faction then boasted its literary zeal, that the great
men, who on other occasions practised all the violence of
opposition, would emulate each other in their encouragement of a
poet who delighted all, and by whom none had been offended.&nbsp;
With these hopes, he offered an English &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; to
subscribers, in six volumes in quarto, for six guineas, a sum
according to the value of money at that time by no means
inconsiderable, and greater than I believe to have been ever
asked before.&nbsp; His proposal, however, was very favourably
received, and the patrons of literature were busy to recommend
his undertaking and promote his interest.&nbsp; Lord Oxford,
indeed, lamented that such a genius should be wasted upon a work
not original, but proposed no means by which he might live
without it.&nbsp; Addison recommended caution and moderation, and
advised him not to be content with the praise of half the nation
when he might be universally favoured.</p>
<p>The greatness of the design, the popularity of the author, and
the attention of the literary world, naturally raised such
expectations of the future sale, that the booksellers made their
offers with great eagerness; but the highest bidder was Bernard
Lintot, who became proprietor on condition of supplying, at his
own expense, all the copies which were to be delivered to
subscribers, or presented to friends, and paying two hundred
pounds for every volume.</p>
<p>Of the quartos it was, I believe, stipulated that none should
be printed but for the author, that the subscription might not be
depreciated; but Lintot impressed the same pages upon a small
folio, and paper perhaps a little thinner, and sold exactly at
half the price, for half a guinea each volume, books so little
inferior to the quartos that, by fraud of trade, those folios
being afterwards shortened by cutting away the top and bottom,
were sold as copies printed for the subscribers.</p>
<p>Lintot printed two hundred and fifty on royal paper in folio
for two guineas a volume; of the small folio, having printed
seventeen hundred and fifty copies of the first volume, he
reduced the number in the other volumes to a thousand.&nbsp; It
is unpleasant to relate that the bookseller, after all his hopes
and all his liberality, was, by a very unjust and illegal action,
defrauded of his profit.&nbsp; An edition of the English
&ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; was printed in Holland in duodecimo, and
imported clandestinely for the gratification of those who were
impatient to read what they could not yet afford to buy.&nbsp;
This fraud could only be counteracted by an edition equally cheap
and more commodious; and Lintot was compelled to contract his
folio at once into a duodecimo, and lose the advantage of an
intermediate gradation.&nbsp; The notes which in the Dutch copies
were placed at the end of each book as they had been in the large
volumes, were now subjoined to the text in the same page, and are
therefore more easily consulted.&nbsp; Of this edition two
thousand five hundred were first printed, and five thousand a few
weeks afterwards; but indeed great numbers were necessary to
produce considerable profit.</p>
<p>Pope, having now emitted his proposals, and engaged not only
his own reputation but in some degree that of his friends who
patronised his subscription, began to be frightened at his own
undertaking, and finding himself at first embarrassed with
difficulties which retarded and oppressed him, he was for a time
timorous and uneasy, had his nights disturbed by dreams of long
journeys through unknown ways, and wished, as he said,
&ldquo;that somebody would hang him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This misery,
however, was not of long continuance; he grew by degrees more
acquainted with Homer&rsquo;s images and expressions, and
practice increased his facility of versification.&nbsp; In a
short time he represents himself as despatching regularly fifty
verses a day, which would show him by an easy computation, the
termination of his labour.&nbsp; His own diffidence was not his
only vexation.&nbsp; He that asks a subscription soon finds that
he has enemies.&nbsp; All who do not encourage him defame
him.&nbsp; He that wants money would rather be thought angry than
poor; and he that wishes to save his money conceals his avarice
by his malice.&nbsp; Addison had hinted his suspicion that Pope
was too much a Tory; and some of the Tories suspected his
principles because he had contributed to the <i>Guardian</i>,
which was carried on by Steele.</p>
<p>To those who censured his politics were added enemies more
dangerous, who called in question his knowledge of Greek, and his
qualifications for a translator of &ldquo;Homer.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
these he made no public opposition, but in one of his letters
escapes from them as well as he can.&nbsp; At an age like his,
for he was not more than twenty-five, with an irregular education
and a course of life of which much seems to have passed in
conversation, it is not very likely that he overflowed with
Greek.&nbsp; But when he felt himself deficient he sought
assistance, and what man of learning would refuse to help
him?&nbsp; Minute inquiries into the force of words are less
necessary in translating Homer than other poets, because his
positions are general, and his representations natural, with very
little dependence on local or temporary customs, on those
changeable scenes of artificial life, which, by mingling original
with accidental notions and crowding the mind with images which
time effaces, produces ambiguity in dictation and obscurity in
books.&nbsp; To this open display of unadulterated nature it must
be ascribed that Homer has fewer passages of doubtful meaning
than any other poet either in the learned or in modern
languages.&nbsp; I have read of a man who, being by his ignorance
of Greek compelled to gratify his curiosity with the Latin
printed on the opposite page, declared that from the rude
simplicity of the lines literally rendered he formed nobler ideas
of the Homeric majesty than from the laboured elegance of
polished versions.&nbsp; Those literal translations were always
at hand, and from them he could easily obtain his author&rsquo;s
sense with sufficient certainty and among the readers of Homer
the number is very small of those who find much in the Greek more
than in the Latin, except the music of the numbers.</p>
<p>If more help was wanting he had the poetical translation of
Eobanus Hessus, an unwearied writer of Latin verses; he had the
French Homers of La Valterie and Dacier, and the English of
Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby.&nbsp; With Chapman, whose work,
though now totally neglected, seems to have been popular almost
to the end of the last century, he had very frequent
consultations, and perhaps never translated any passage till he
had read his version, which he indeed has been sometimes
suspected of using instead of the original.&nbsp; Notes were
likewise to be provided, for the six volumes would have been very
little more than six pamphlets without them.&nbsp; What the mere
perusal of the text could suggest Pope wanted no assistance to
collect or methodise; but more was necessary.&nbsp; Many pages
were to be filled, and learning must supply materials to wit and
judgment.&nbsp; Something might be gathered from Dacier, but no
man loves to be indebted to his contemporaries, and Dacier was
accessible to common readers.&nbsp; Eustathius was therefore
necessarily consulted.&nbsp; To read Eustathius, of whose work
there was then no Latin version, I suspect Pope if he had been
willing not to have been able.&nbsp; Some other was therefore to
be found who had leisure as well as abilities, and he was
doubtless most readily employed who would do much work for little
money.</p>
<p>The history of the notes has never been traced.&nbsp; Broome,
an his preface to his poems, declares himself the commentator
&ldquo;in part upon the &lsquo;Iliad,&rsquo;&rdquo; and it
appears from Fenton&rsquo;s letter, preserved in the Museum, that
Broome was at first engaged in consulting Eustathius; but that
after a time, whatever was the reason, he desisted.&nbsp; Another
man of Cambridge was then employed, who soon grew weary of the
work, and a third, that was recommended by Thirlby, is now
discovered to have been Jortin, a man since well known to the
learned world, who complained that Pope, having accepted and
approved his performance, never testified any curiosity to see
him, and who professed to have forgotten the terms on which he
worked.&nbsp; The terms which Fenton uses are very mercantile:
&ldquo;I think at first sight that his performance is very
commendable, and have sent word for him to finish the seventeenth
book, and to send it with his demands for his trouble.&nbsp; I
have here enclosed the specimen; if the rest come before the
return, I will keep them till I receive your order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Broome then offered his service a second time, which was
probably accepted, as they had afterwards a closer
correspondence.&nbsp; Parnell contributed the &ldquo;Life of
Homer,&rdquo; which Pope found so harsh, that he took great pains
in correcting it; and by his own diligence, with such help as
kindness or money could procure him, in somewhat more than five
years he completed his version of the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; with
the notes.&nbsp; He began it in 1712, his twenty-fifth year, and
concluded it in 1718, his thirtieth year.&nbsp; When we find him
translating fifty lines a day, it is natural to suppose that he
would have brought his work to a more speedy conclusion.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; containing less than sixteen thousand
verses, might have been despatched in less than three hundred and
twenty days by fifty verses in a day.&nbsp; The notes, compiled
with the assistance of his mercenaries, could not be supposed to
require more time than the text.&nbsp; According to this
calculation, the progress of Pope may seem to have been slow; but
the distance is commonly very great between actual performances
and speculative possibility.&nbsp; It is natural to suppose, that
as much as has been done to-day may be done to-morrow; but on the
morrow some difficulty emerges, or some external impediment
obstructs.</p>
<p>Indolence, interruption, business, and pleasure, all take
their turns of retardation; and every long work is lengthened by
a thousand causes that can, and ten thousand that cannot, be
recounted.&nbsp; Perhaps no extensive and multifarious
performance was ever effected within the term originally fixed in
the undertaker&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; He that runs against time has
an antagonist not subject to casualties.</p>
<p>The encouragement given to this translation, though report
seems to have overrated it, was such as the world has not often
seen.&nbsp; The subscribers were five hundred and
seventy-five.&nbsp; The copies, for which subscriptions were
given, were six hundred and fifty-four; and only six hundred and
sixty were printed.&nbsp; For these copies Pope had nothing to
pay.&nbsp; He therefore received, including the two hundred
pounds a volume, five thousand three hundred and twenty pounds,
four shillings, without deduction, as the books were supplied by
Lintot.</p>
<p>By the success of his subscription Pope was relieved from
those pecuniary distresses with which, notwithstanding his
popularity, he had hitherto struggled.&nbsp; Lord Oxford had
often lamented his disqualification for public employment, but
never proposed a pension.&nbsp; While the translation of
&ldquo;Homer&rdquo; was in its progress, Mr. Craggs, then
Secretary of State, offered to procure him a pension, which, at
least during his ministry, might be enjoyed with secrecy.&nbsp;
This was not accepted by Pope, who told him, however, that, if he
should be pressed with want of money, he would send to him for
occasional supplies.&nbsp; Craggs was not long in power, and was
never solicited for money by Pope, who disdained to beg what he
did not want.</p>
<p>With the product of this subscription, which he had too much
discretion to squander, he secured his future life from want, by
considerable annuities.&nbsp; The estate of the Duke of
Buckingham was found to have been charged with five hundred
pounds a year, payable to Pope, which doubtless his translation
enabled him to purchase.</p>
<p>It cannot be unwelcome to literary curiosity, that I deduce
thus minutely the history of the English
&ldquo;Iliad.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is certainly the noblest version of
poetry which the world has ever seen, and its publication must
therefore be considered as one of the great events in the annals
of learning.&nbsp; To those who have skill to estimate the
excellence and difficulty of this great work, it must be very
desirable to know how it was performed, and by what gradations it
advanced to correctness.&nbsp; Of such an intellectual process
the knowledge has very rarely been attainable; but happily there
remains the original copy of the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; which,
being obtained by Bolingbroke as a curiosity, descended from him
to Mallet, and is now, by the solicitation of the late Dr. Maty,
reposited in the Museum.&nbsp; Between this manuscript, which is
written upon accidental fragments of paper, and the printed
edition, there must have been an intermediate copy, that was
perhaps destroyed as it returned from the press.</p>
<p>From the first copy I have procured a few transcripts, and
shall exhibit first the printed lines; then, in a small print,
those of the manuscripts, with all their variations.&nbsp; Those
words in the small print, which are given in italics, are
cancelled in the copy, and the words placed under them adopted in

<p>Of these specimens every man who has cultivated poetry, or who
delights to trace the mind from the rudeness of its first
conceptions to the elegance of its last, will naturally desire a
great number; but most other readers are already tired, and I am
not writing only to poets and philosophers.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; was published volume by volume, as the
translation proceeded.&nbsp; The four first books appeared in
1713.&nbsp; The expectation of this work was undoubtedly high,
and every man who had connected his name with criticism or poetry
was desirous of such intelligence as might enable him to talk
upon the popular topic.&nbsp; Halifax, who, by having been first
a poet, and then a patron of poetry, had acquired the right of
being a judge, was willing to hear some books while they were yet
unpublished.&nbsp; Of this rehearsal Pope afterwards gave the
following account:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The famous Lord Halifax was rather a
pretender to taste than really possessed of it.&nbsp; When I had
finished the two or three first books of my translation of the
&lsquo;Iliad,&rsquo; that lord desired to have the pleasure of
hearing them read at his house.&nbsp; Addison, Congreve, and
Garth were there at the reading.&nbsp; In four or five places
Lord Halifax stopped me very civilly, and with a speech each time
of much the same kind, &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Pope, but
there is something in that passage that does not please me.&nbsp;
Be so good as to mark the place, and consider it a little at your
leisure.&nbsp; I am sure you can give it a little
turn.&rsquo;&nbsp; I returned from Lord Halifax&rsquo;s with Dr.
Garth in his chariot, and as we were going along was saying to
the Doctor that my lord had laid me under a great deal of
difficulty by such loose and general observations; that I had
been thinking over the passages almost ever since, and could not
guess at what it was that offended his lordship in either of
them.&nbsp; Garth laughed heartily at my embarrassment: said I
had not been long enough acquainted with Lord Halifax to know his
way yet; that I need not puzzle myself about looking those places
over and over when I got home.&nbsp; &lsquo;All you need
do,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is to leave them just as they are,
call on Lord Halifax two or three months hence, thank him for his
kind observations on those passages, and then read them to him as
altered.&nbsp; I have known him much longer than you have, and
will be answerable for the event.&rsquo;&nbsp; I followed his
advice, waited on Lord Halifax some time after; said I hoped he
would find his objections to those passages removed; read them to
him exactly as they were at first; and his lordship was extremely
pleased with them, and cried out, &lsquo;Ay, now they are
perfectly right; nothing can be better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is seldom that the great or the wise suspect that they are
despised or cheated.&nbsp; Halifax, thinking this a lucky
opportunity of securing immortality, made some advances of favour
and some overtures of advantage to Pope, which he seems to have
received with sullen coldness.&nbsp; All our knowledge of this
transaction is derived from a single letter (December 1, 1714),
in which Pope says, &ldquo;I am obliged to you, both for the
favours you have done me and those you intend me.&nbsp; I
distrust neither your will nor your memory when it is to do good;
and if I ever become troublesome or solicitous, it must not be
out of expectation, but out of gratitude.&nbsp; Your lordship may
cause me to live agreeably in the town, or contentedly in the
country, which is really all the difference I set between an easy
fortune and a small one.&nbsp; It is indeed a high strain of
generosity in you to think of making me easy all my life, only
because I have been so happy as to divert you some few hours;
but, if I may have leave to add it is because you think me no
enemy to my native country, there will appear a better reason;
for I must of consequence be very much (as I sincerely am) yours,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These voluntary offers, and this faint acceptance, ended
without effect.&nbsp; The patron was not accustomed to such
frigid gratitude; and the poet fed his own pride with the dignity
of independence.&nbsp; They probably were suspicious of each
other.&nbsp; Pope would not dedicate till he saw at what rate his
praise was valued; he would be &ldquo;troublesome out of
gratitude, not expectation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Halifax thought himself
entitled to confidence, and would give nothing unless he knew
what he should receive.&nbsp; Their commerce had its beginning in
hope of praise on one side and of money on the other, and ended
because Pope was less eager of money than Halifax of
praise.&nbsp; It is not likely that Halifax had any personal
benevolence to Pope; it is evident that Pope looked on Halifax
with scorn and hatred.</p>
<p>The reputation of this great work failed of gaining him a
patron but it deprived him of a friend.&nbsp; Addison and he were
now at the head of poetry and criticism, and both in such a state
of elevation that, like the two rivals in the Roman State, one
could no longer bear an equal, nor the other a superior.&nbsp; Of
the gradual abatement of kindness between friends, the beginning
is often scarcely discernible to themselves, and the process is
continued by petty provocations, and incivilities sometimes
peevishly returned, and sometimes contemptuously neglected, which
would escape all attention but that of pride, and drop from any
memory but that of resentment.&nbsp; That the quarrel of these
two wits should be minutely deduced is not to be expected from a
writer to whom, as Homer says, &ldquo;nothing but rumour has
reached, and who has no personal knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pope doubtless approached Addison, when the reputation of
their wit first brought them together, with the respect due to a
man whose abilities were acknowledged, and who, having attained
that eminence to which he was himself aspiring, had in his hands
the distribution of literary fame.&nbsp; He paid court with
sufficient diligence by his prologue to &ldquo;Cato,&rdquo; by
his abuse of Dennis, and with praise yet more direct, by his poem
on the &ldquo;Dialogues on Medals,&rdquo; of which the immediate
publication was then intended.&nbsp; In all this there was no
hypocrisy for he confessed that he found in Addison something
more pleasing than in any other man.</p>
<p>It may be supposed that, as Pope saw himself favoured by the
world, and more frequently compared his own powers with those of
others, his confidence increased, and his submission lessened;
and that Addison felt no delight from the advances of a young
wit, who might soon contend with him for the highest place.&nbsp;
Every great man, of whatever kind be his greatness, has among his
friends those who officiously or insidiously quicken his
attention to offences, heighten his disgust, and stimulate his
resentment.&nbsp; Of such adherents Addison doubtless had many;
and Pope was now too high to be without them.&nbsp; From the
emission and reception of the proposals for the
&ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; the kindness of Addison seems to have
abated.&nbsp; Jervas the painter once pleased himself (August 20,
1714) with imagining that he had re-established their friendship,
and wrote to Pope that Addison once suspected him of too close a
confederacy with Swift, but was now satisfied with his
conduct.&nbsp; To this Pope answered, a week after, that his
engagements to Swift were such as his services in regard to the
subscription demanded, and that the Tories never put him under
the necessity of asking leave to be grateful.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;as Mr. Addison must be the
judge in what regards himself, and seems to have no very just one
in regard to me, so I must own to you I expect nothing but
civility from him.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same letter he mentions
Philips, as having been busy to kindle animosity between them;
but in a letter to Addison he expresses some consciousness of
behaviour, inattentively deficient in respect.</p>
<p>Of Swift&rsquo;s industry in promoting the subscription there
remains the testimony of Kennet, no friend to either him or
Pope.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;November 2, 1713, Dr. Swift came into the
coffee-house, and had a bow from everybody but me, who, I
confess, could not but despise him.&nbsp; When I came to the
antechamber to wait, before prayers, Dr. Swift was the principal
man of talk and business, and acted as master of requests.&nbsp;
Then he instructed a young nobleman that the <i>best poet in
England</i> was Mr. Pope (a papist), who had begun a translation
of &lsquo;Homer&rsquo; into English verse, for which <i>he must
have them all subscribe</i>: for, says he, the author <i>shall
not</i> begin to print till <i>I have</i> a thousand guineas for
him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About this time it is likely that Steele, who was, with all
his political fury, good-natured and officious, procured an
interview between these angry rivals, which ended in aggravated
malevolence.&nbsp; On this occasion, if the reports be true, Pope
made his complaint with frankness and spirit, as a man
undeservedly neglected or opposed; and Addison affected a
contemptuous unconcern, and in a calm, even voice reproached Pope
with his vanity, and, telling him of the improvements which his
early works had received from his own remarks and those of
Steele, said that he, being now engaged in public business, had
no longer any care for his poetical reputation, nor had any other
desire with regard to Pope than that he should not, by too much
arrogance, alienate the public.</p>
<p>To this Pope is said to have replied with great keenness and
severity, upbraiding Addison with perpetual dependence, and with
the abuse of those qualifications which he had obtained at the
public cost, and charging him with mean endeavours to obstruct
the progress of rising merit.&nbsp; The contest rose so high that
they parted at last without any interchange of civility.</p>
<p>The first volume of &ldquo;Homer&rdquo; was (1715) in time
published; and a rival version of the first &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo;
for rivals the time of their appearance inevitably made them, was
immediately printed, with the name of Tickell.&nbsp; It was soon
perceived that, among the followers of Addison, Tickell had the
preference, and the critics and poets divided into
factions.&nbsp; &ldquo;I,&rdquo; says Pope, &ldquo;have the town,
that is, the mob, on my side; but it is not uncommon for the
smaller party to supply by industry what it wants in
numbers.&nbsp; I appeal to the people as my rightful judges, and,
while they are not inclined to condemn me, shall not fear the
high-flyers at Button&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; This opposition he
immediately imputed to Addison, and complained of it in terms
sufficiently resentful to Craggs, their common friend.</p>
<p>When Addison&rsquo;s opinion was asked, he declared the
versions to be both good, but Tickell&rsquo;s the best that had
ever been written; and sometimes said that they were both good,
but that Tickell had more of &ldquo;Homer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pope was now sufficiently irritated; his reputation and his
interest were at hazard.&nbsp; He once intended to print together
the four versions of Dryden, Maynwaring, Pope, and Tickell, that
they might be readily compared and fairly estimated.&nbsp; This
design seems to have been defeated by the refusal off Tonson, who
was the proprietor of the other three versions.</p>
<p>Pope intended, at another time, a rigorous criticism of
Tickell&rsquo;s translation, and had marked a copy, which I have
seen, in all places that appeared defective.&nbsp; But while he
was thus meditating defence or revenge, his adversary sunk before
him without a blow; the voice of the public was not long divided,
and the preference universally given to Pope&rsquo;s
performance.&nbsp; He was convinced, by adding one circumstance
to another, that the other translation was the work of Addison
himself; but, if he knew it in Addison&rsquo;s lifetime, it does
not appear that he told it.&nbsp; He left his illustrious
antagonist to lie punished by what has been considered as the
most painful of all reflections&mdash;the remembrance of a crime
perpetrated in vain.&nbsp; The other circumstances of their
quarrel were thus related by Pope:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Philips seemed to have been encouraged to
abuse me in coffee-houses and conversations, and Gildon wrote a
thing about Wycherley, in which he had abused both me and my
relations very grossly.&nbsp; Lord Warwick himself told me one
day that it was in vain for me to endeavour to be well with Mr.
Addison; that his jealous temper would never admit of a settled
friendship between us; and, to convince me of what he had said,
assured me that Addison had encouraged Gildon to publish those
scandals, and had given him ten guineas after they were
published.&nbsp; The next day, while I was heated with what I had
heard, I wrote a letter to Mr. Addison, to let him know that I
was not unacquainted with this behaviour of his; that if I was to
speak severely of him in return for it, it should not be in such
a dirty way; that I should rather tell him himself fairly of his
faults, and allow his good qualities; and that it should be
something in the following manner.&nbsp; I then adjoined the
first sketch of what has since been called my satire on
Addison.&nbsp; Mr Addison used me very civilly ever
after.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verses on Addison, when they were sent to Atterbury, were
considered by him as the most excellent of Pope&rsquo;s
performances; and the writer was advised, since he knew where his
strength lay, not to suffer it to remain unemployed.&nbsp; This
year (1715), being by the subscription enabled to live more by
choice, having persuaded his father to sell their estate at
Binfield, he purchased, I think only for his life, that house at
Twickenham to which his residence afterwards procured so much
celebration, and removed thither with his father and
mother.&nbsp; Here he planted the vines and the quincunx which
his verses mention; and being under the necessity of making a
subterraneous passage to a garden on the other side of the road,
he adorned it with fossil bodies, and dignified it with the title
of a grotto; a place of silence and retreat, from which he
endeavoured to persuade his friends and himself that cares and
passions could be excluded.</p>
<p>A grotto is not often the wish or pleasure of all Englishmen,
who has more frequent need to solicit than exclude the sun; but
Pope&rsquo;s excavation was requisite as an entrance to his
garden; and, as some men try to be proud of their defects, he
extracted an ornament from an inconvenience, and vanity produced
a grotto where necessity enforced a passage.&nbsp; It may be
frequently remarked of the studious and speculative, that they
are proud of trifles, and that their amusements seem frivolous
and childish.&nbsp; Whether it be that men, conscious of great
reputation, think themselves above the reach of censure, and safe
in the admission of negligent indulgences, or that mankind expect
from elevated genius a uniformity of greatness, and watch its
degradation with malicious wonder, like him who, having followed
with his eye an eagle into the clouds, should lament that she
ever descended to a perch.</p>
<p>While the volumes of his &ldquo;Homer&rdquo; were annually
published, he collected his former works (1717) into one quarto
volume, to which he prefixed a preface, written with great
sprightliness and elegance, which was afterwards reprinted, with
some passages subjoined that he at first omitted.&nbsp; Other
marginal additions of the same kind he made in the later editions
of his poems.&nbsp; Waller remarks, that poets lose half their
praise, because the reader knows not what they have
blotted.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s voracity of fame taught him the art
of obtaining the accumulated honour both of what he had
published, and of what he had suppressed.&nbsp; In this year his
father died suddenly, in his seventy-fifth year, having passed
twenty-nine years in privacy.&nbsp; He is not known but by the
character which his son has given him.&nbsp; If the money with
which he retired was all gotten by himself, he had traded very
successfully in times when sudden riches were rarely
attainable.</p>
<p>The publication of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; was at last
completed in 1720.&nbsp; The splendour and success of this work
raised Pope many enemies that endeavoured to depreciate his
abilities.&nbsp; Burnet, who was afterwards a judge of no mean
reputation, censured him in a piece called
&ldquo;Homerides&rdquo; before it was published.&nbsp; Ducket
likewise endeavoured to make him ridiculous.&nbsp; Dennis was the
perpetual persecutor of all his studies.&nbsp; But whoever his
critics were, their writings are lost, and the names, which are
preserved are preserved in the &ldquo;Dunciad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this disastrous year (1720) of national infatuation, when
more riches than Peru can boast were expected from the South Sea,
when the contagion of avarice tainted every mind, and even poets
panted after wealth, Pope was seized with the universal passion,
and ventured some of his money.&nbsp; The stock rose in its
price, and for a while he thought himself the lord of
thousands.&nbsp; But this dream of happiness did not last long,
and he seems to have waked soon enough to get clear with the loss
of what he once thought himself to have won, and perhaps not
wholly of that.</p>
<p>Next year he published some select poems of his friend Dr.
Parnell, with a very elegant dedication to the Earl of Oxford,
who, after all his struggles and dangers, then lived in
retirement, still under the frown of a victorious faction, who
could take no pleasure in hearing his praise.&nbsp; He gave the
same year (1721) an edition of Shakespeare.&nbsp; His name was
now of so much authority that Tonson thought himself entitled, by
annexing it, to demand a subscription of six guineas for
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays in six quarto volumes.&nbsp; Nor did
his expectation much deceive him, for, of seven hundred and fifty
which he printed, he dispersed a great number at the price
proposed.&nbsp; The reputation of that edition indeed, sunk,
afterwards so low, that one hundred and forty copies were sold at
sixteen shillings each.&nbsp; On this undertaking, to which Pope
was induced by a reward of two hundred and seventeen pounds
twelve shillings, he seems never to have reflected afterwards
without vexation; for Theobald a man of heavy diligence, with
very slender powers, first, in a book called &ldquo;Shakespeare
Restored,&rdquo; and then in a formal edition, detected his
deficiencies with all the insolence of victory; and as he was now
high enough to be feared and hated, Theobald had from others all
the help that could be supplied, by the desire of humbling a
haughty character.&nbsp; From this time Pope became an enemy to
editors, collators, commentators, and verbal critics, and hoped
to persuade the world that he miscarried in this undertaking only
by having a mind too great for such minute employment.</p>
<p>Pope in his edition undoubtedly did many things wrong, and
left many things undone; but let him not be defrauded of his due
praise.&nbsp; He was the first that knew, at least the first that
told, by what helps the text might be improved.&nbsp; If he
inspected the early editions negligently, he taught others to be
more accurate.&nbsp; In his preface he expanded with great skill
and elegance the character which had been given of Shakespeare by
Dryden; and he drew the public attention upon his works, which,
though often mentioned, had been little read.&nbsp; Soon after
the appearance of the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; resolving not to let
the general kindness cool, he published proposals for a
translation of the &ldquo;Odyssey,&rdquo; in five volumes, for
five guineas.&nbsp; He was willing, however, now to have
associates in his labour, being either weary with toiling upon
another&rsquo;s thoughts, or having heard, as Ruffhead relates,
that Fenton and Broome had already begun the work, and liking
better to have them confederates than rivals.&nbsp; In the
patent, instead of saying that he had &ldquo;translated&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Odyssey,&rdquo; as he had said of the
&ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; he says that he had &ldquo;undertaken&rdquo;
a translation: and in the proposals, the subscription is said to
be not solely for his own use, but for that of &ldquo;two of his
friends who have assisted him in his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1723, while he was engaged in this new version, he appeared
before the Lords at the memorable trial of Bishop Atterbury, with
whom he had lived in great familiarity, and frequent
correspondence.&nbsp; Atterbury had honestly recommended to him
the study of the Popish controversy, in hope of his conversion;
to which Pope answered in a manner that cannot much recommend his
principles or his judgment.&nbsp; In questions and projects of
learning they agree better.&nbsp; He was called at the trial to
give an account of Atterbury&rsquo;s domestic life and private
employment, that it might appear how little time he had left for
plots.&nbsp; Pope had but few words to utter, and in those few he
made several blunders.</p>
<p>His letters to Atterbury express the utmost esteem,
tenderness, and gratitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;it is not only in this world that I may have cause to
remember the Bishop of Rochester.&rdquo;&nbsp; At their last
interview in the Tower, Atterbury presented him with a Bible.</p>
<p>Of the &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; Pope translated only twelve
books.&nbsp; The rest were the work of Broome and Fenton: the
notes were written wholly by Broome, who was not over liberally
rewarded.&nbsp; The public was carefully kept ignorant of the
several shares; and an account was subjoined at the conclusion
which is now known not to be true.&nbsp; The first copy of
Pope&rsquo;s books, with those of Fenton, are to be seen in the
Museum.&nbsp; The parts of Pope are less interlined than the
&ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; and the latter books of the
&ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; less than the former.&nbsp; He grew dexterous
by practice, and every sheet enabled him to write the next with
more facility.&nbsp; The books of Fenton have very few
alterations by the hand of Pope.&nbsp; Those of Broome have not
been found, but Pope complained, as it is reported, that he had
much trouble in correcting them.&nbsp; His contract with Lintot
was the same as for the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; except that only one
hundred pounds were to be paid him for each volume.&nbsp; The
number of subscribers were five hundred and seventy-four, and of
copies eight hundred and nineteen, so that his profit, when he
had paid his assistants, was still very considerable.&nbsp; The
work was finished in 1723; and from that time he resolved to make
no more translations.&nbsp; The sale did not answer
Lintot&rsquo;s expectation, and he then pretended to discover
something of a fraud in Pope, and commenced or threatened a suit
in Chancery.</p>
<p>On the English &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; a criticism was published
by Spence, at that time Prelector of Poetry at Oxford, a man
whose learning was not very great, and whose mind was not very
powerful.&nbsp; His criticism, however, was commonly just; what
he thought he thought rightly, and his remarks were recommended
by his coolness and candour.&nbsp; In him Pope had the first
experience of a critic without malevolence, who thought it as
much his duty to display beauties as expose faults, who censured
with respect, and praised with alacrity.&nbsp; With this
criticism Pope was so little offended, that he sought the
acquaintance of the writer, who lived with him from that time in
great familiarity, attended him in his last hours, and compiled
memorials of his conversation.&nbsp; The regard of Pope
recommended him to the great and powerful, and he obtained very
valuable preferments in the Church.&nbsp; Not long after Pope was
returning home from a visit in a friend&rsquo;s coach, which, in
passing a bridge, was overturned into the water; the
window&rsquo;s were closed, and, being unable to force them open,
he was in danger of immediate death, when the postillion snatched
him out by breaking the glass, of which the fragments cut two of
his fingers in such a manner that he lost their use.</p>
<p>Voltaire, who was then in England, sent him a letter of
consolation.&nbsp; He had been entertained by Pope at his table,
where he talked with so much grossness that Mrs. Pope was driven
from the room.&nbsp; Pope discovered, by a trick, that he was a
spy for the Court, and never considered him as a man worthy of
confidence.&nbsp; He soon afterwards (1727) joined with Swift,
who was then in England, to publish three volumes of
&ldquo;Miscellanies,&rdquo; in which, amongst other things, he
inserted the &ldquo;Memoirs of a Parish Clerk,&rdquo; in ridicule
of Burnet&rsquo;s importance in his own history, and a
&ldquo;Debate upon Black and White Horses,&rdquo; written in all
the formalities of a legal process by the assistance, as is said,
of Mr. Fortescue, afterwards Master of the Rolls.&nbsp; Before
these &ldquo;Miscellanies&rdquo; is a preface signed by Swift and
Pope, but apparently written by Pope, in which he makes a
ridiculous and romantic complaint of the robberies committed upon
authors by the clandestine seizure and sale of their
papers.&nbsp; He tells in tragic strains how &ldquo;the cabinets
of the sick and the closets of the dead have been broken open and
ransacked,&rdquo; as if those violences were often committed for
papers of uncertain and accidental value which are rarely
provoked by real treasures&mdash;as if epigrams and essays were
in danger where gold and diamonds are safe.&nbsp; A cat hunted
for his musk is, according to Pope&rsquo;s account, but the
emblem of a wit winded by booksellers.&nbsp; His complaint,
however, received some attestation, for the same year the letters
written by him to Mr. Cromwell in his youth were sold by Mrs.
Thomas to Curll, who printed them.</p>
<p>In these &ldquo;Miscellanies&rdquo; was first published the
&ldquo;Art of Sinking in Poetry,&rdquo; which, by such a train of
consequences as usually passes in literary quarrels, gave in a
short time, according to Pope&rsquo;s account, occasion to the
&ldquo;Dunciad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following year (1728) he began to put Atterbury&rsquo;s
advice in practice, and showed his satirical powers by publishing
the &ldquo;Dunciad,&rdquo; one of his greatest and most elaborate
performances, in which he endeavoured to sink into contempt all
the writers by whom he had been attacked, and some others whom he
thought unable to defend themselves.&nbsp; At the head of the
&ldquo;Dunces&rdquo; he placed poor Theobald, whom he accused of
ingratitude, but whose real crime was supposed to be that of
having revised Shakespeare more happily than himself.&nbsp; This
satire had the effect which he intended, by blasting the
characters which it touched.&nbsp; Ralph, who, unnecessarily
interposing in the quarrel, got a place in a subsequent edition,
complained that for a time he was in danger of starving, as the
booksellers had no longer any confidence in his capacity.&nbsp;
The prevalence of this poem was gradual and slow: the plan, if
not wholly new, was little understood by common readers.&nbsp;
Many of the allusions required illustration; the names were often
expressed only by the initial and final letters, and if they had
been printed at length were such as few had known or
recollected.&nbsp; The subject itself had nothing generally
interesting, for whom did it concern to know that one or another
scribbler was a dunce?&nbsp; If, therefore, it had been possible
for those who were attacked to conceal their pain and their
resentment, the &ldquo;Dunciad&rdquo; might have made its way
very slowly in the world.&nbsp; This, however, was not to be
expected: every man is of importance to himself, and therefore,
in his own opinion, to others; and, supposing the world already
acquainted with all his pleasures and his pains, is perhaps the
first to publish injuries or misfortunes, which had never been
known unless related by himself, and at which those that hear
them will only laugh, for no man sympathises with the sorrows of
vanity.</p>
<p>The history of the &ldquo;Dunciad&rdquo; is very minutely
related by Pope himself in a dedication which he wrote to Lord
Middlesex in the name of Savage.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will relate the war of the
&lsquo;Dunces&rsquo; (for so it has been commonly called), which
began in the year 1727, and ended in 1730</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Dr. Swift and Mr. Pope thought it proper, for
reasons specified in the preface to their
&lsquo;Miscellanies,&rsquo; to publish such little pieces of
theirs as had occasionally got abroad, there was added to them
the &lsquo;Treatise of the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in
Poetry.&rsquo;&nbsp; It happened that in one chapter of this
piece the several species of bad poets were ranged in classes, to
which were prefixed almost all the letters of the alphabet (the
greatest part of them at random); but such was the number of
poets eminent in that art, that some one or other took every
letter to himself.&nbsp; All fell into so violent a fury, that,
for half a year or more, the common newspapers (in most of which
they had some property, as being hired writers) were filled with
the most abusive falsehoods and scurrilities they could possibly
devise, a liberty no way to be wondered at in those people, and
in those papers, that, for many years during the uncontrolled
license of the Press, had aspersed almost all the great
characters of the age; and this with impunity, their own persons
and names being utterly secret and obscure.&nbsp; This gave Mr.
Pope the thought that he had now some opportunity of doing good
by detecting and dragging into light these common enemies of
mankind, since, to invalidate this universal slander, it sufficed
to show what contemptible men were the authors of it.&nbsp; He
was not without hopes that, by manifesting the dulness of those
who had only malice to recommend them, either the booksellers
would not find their account in employing them, or the men
themselves, when discovered, want courage to proceed in so
unlawful an occupation.&nbsp; This it was that gave birth to the
&lsquo;Dunciad,&rsquo; and he thought it a happiness that, by the
late flood of slander on himself, he had acquired such a peculiar
right over their names as was necessary to this design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 12th of March, 1729, at St. James&rsquo;s, that
poem was presented to the king and queen (who had before been
pleased to read it) by the Right Honourable Sir Robert Walpole,
and some days after the whole impression was taken and dispersed
by several noblemen and persons of the first distinction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly a true observation that no people are
so impatient of censure as those who are the greatest slanderers,
which was wonderfully exemplified on this occasion.&nbsp; On the
day the book was first vended a crowd of authors besieged the
shop; entreaties, advices, threats of law and battery&mdash;nay,
cries of treason&mdash;were all employed to hinder the coming out
of the &lsquo;Dunciad.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the other side, the
booksellers and hawkers made as great efforts to procure
it.&nbsp; What could a few poor authors do against so great a
majority as the public?&nbsp; There was no stopping a torrent
with a finger, so out it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many ludicrous circumstances attended it.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Dunces&rsquo; (for by this name they were called) held
weekly clubs, to consult of hostilities against the author.&nbsp;
One wrote a letter to a great minister, assuring him Mr. Pope was
the greatest enemy the Government had, and another bought his
image in clay to execute him in effigy, with which sad sort of
satisfaction the gentlemen were a little comforted.&nbsp; Some
false editions of the book, having an owl in their frontispiece,
the true one, to distinguish it, fixed in his stead an ass laden
with authors.&nbsp; Then another surreptitious one being printed
with the same ass, the new edition in octavo returned for
distinction to the owl again.&nbsp; Hence arose a great contest
of booksellers against booksellers, and advertisements against
advertisements, some recommending the edition of the owl, and
others the edition of the ass, by which names they came to be
distinguished, to the great honour also of the gentlemen of the
&lsquo;Dunciad.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope appears by this narrative to have contemplated his
victory over the &ldquo;Dunces&rdquo; with great exultation; and
such was his delight in the tumult which he had raised, that for
a while his natural sensibility was suspended, and he read
reproaches and invectives without emotion, considering them only
as the necessary effects of that pain which he rejoiced in having
given.&nbsp; It cannot, however, be concealed that, by his own
confession, he was the aggressor, for nobody believes that the
letters in the &ldquo;Bathos&rdquo; were placed at random; and at
may be discovered that, when he thinks himself concealed, he
indulges the common vanity of common men, and triumphs in those
distinctions which he affected to despise.&nbsp; He is proud that
his book was presented to the king and queen by the Right
Honourable Sir Robert Walpole; he is proud that they had read it
before; he is proud that the edition was taken off by the
nobility and persons of the first distinction.&nbsp; The edition
of which he speaks was, I believe, that which, by telling in the
text the names, and in the notes the characters, of those whom he
had satirised, was made intelligible and diverting.&nbsp; The
critics had now declared their approbation of the plan, and the
common reader began to like it without fear.&nbsp; Those who were
strangers to petty literature, and therefore unable to decipher
initials and blanks, had now names and persons brought within
their view, and delighted in the visible effects of those shafts
of malice which they had hitherto contemplated as shot into the
air.</p>
<p>Dennis, upon the fresh provocation now given him, renewed the
enmity which had for a time been appeased by mutual civilities,
and published remarks, which he had till then suppressed, upon
the &ldquo;Rape of the Lock.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many more grumbled in
secret, or vented their resentment in the newspapers by epigrams
or invectives.&nbsp; Ducket, indeed, being mentioned as loving
Burnet with &ldquo;pious passion,&rdquo; pretended that his moral
character was injured, and for some time declared his resolution
to take vengeance with a cudgel.&nbsp; But Pope appeased him, by
changing &ldquo;pious passion&rdquo; to &ldquo;cordial
friendship,&rdquo; and by a note, in which he vehemently
disclaims the malignity of the meaning imputed to the first
expression.&nbsp; Aaron Hill, who was represented as diving for
the prize, expostulated with Pope in a manner so much superior to
all mean solicitation, that Pope was reduced to sneak and
shuffle, sometimes to deny, and sometimes to apologies; he first
endeavours to wound, and is then afraid to own that he meant a
blow.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Dunciad,&rdquo; in the complete edition, is
addressed to Dr. Swift.&nbsp; Of the notes, part were written by
Dr. Arbuthnot, and an apologetical letter was prefixed, signed by
Cleland, but supposed to have been written by Pope.</p>
<p>After this general war upon dulness, he seems to have indulged
himself a while in tranquillity, but his subsequent productions
prove that he was not idle.&nbsp; He published (1731) a poem on
&ldquo;Taste,&rdquo; in which he very particularly and severely
criticises the house, the furniture, the gardens, and the
entertainments of Timon, a man of great wealth and little
taste.&nbsp; By Timon he was universally supposed, and by the
Earl of Burlington, to whom the poem is addressed, was privately
said, to mean the Duke of Chandos, a man perhaps too much
delighted with pomp and show, but of a temper kind and
beneficent, and who had consequently the voice of the public in
his favour.&nbsp; A violent outcry was, therefore, raised against
the ingratitude and treachery of Pope, who was said to have been
indebted to the patronage of Chandos for a present of a thousand
pounds, and who gained the opportunity of insulting him by the
kindness of his invitation.&nbsp; The receipt of the thousand
pounds Pope publicly denied; but from the reproach which the
attack on a character so amiable brought upon him, he tried all
means of escaping.&nbsp; The name of Cleland was again employed
in an apology, by which no man was satisfied, and he was at last
reduced to shelter his temerity behind dissimulation, and
endeavour to make that disbelieved which he never had confidence
openly to deny.&nbsp; He wrote an exculpatory letter to the duke,
which was answered with great magnanimity, as by a man who
accepted his excuse without believing his professions.&nbsp; He
said that to have ridiculed his taste, or his buildings, had been
an indifferent action in another man, but that in Pope, after the
reciprocal kindness that had been exchanged between them, it had
been less easily excused.</p>
<p>Pope, in one of his letters, complaining of the treatment
which his poem had found, &ldquo;owns that such critics can
intimidate him, nay almost persuade him, to write no more, which
is a compliment this age deserves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man who
threatens the world is always ridiculous, for the world can
easily go on without him, and in a short time will cease to miss
him.&nbsp; I have heard of an idiot, who used to revenge his
vexatious by lying all night upon the bridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
is nothing,&rdquo; says Juvenal, &ldquo;that a man will not
believe in his own favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pope had been flattered
till he thought himself one of the moving powers in the system of
life.&nbsp; When he talked of laying down his pen, those who sat
round him entreated and implored; and self-love did not suffer
him to suspect that they went away and laughed.</p>
<p>The following year deprived him of Gay, a man whom he had
known early, and whom he seemed to love with more tenderness than
any other of his literary friends.&nbsp; Pope was now forty-four
years old, an age at which the mind begins less easily to admit
new confidence, and the will to grow less flexible, and when,
therefore, the departure of an old friend is very acutely
felt.&nbsp; In the next year (1733) he lost his mother, not by an
unexpected death, for she had lasted to the age of
ninety-three.&nbsp; But she did not die unlamented.&nbsp; The
filial piety of Pope was in the highest degree amiable and
exemplary.&nbsp; His parents had the happiness of living till he
was at the summit of poetical reputation, till he was at ease in
his fortune, and without a rival in his fame, and found no
diminution of his respect or tenderness.&nbsp; Whatever was his
pride, to them he was obedient; and whatever was his
irritability, to them he was gentle.&nbsp; Life has, among its
soothing and quiet comforts, few things better to give than such
a son.</p>
<p>One of the passages of Pope&rsquo;s life, which seems to
deserve some inquiry, was a publication of &ldquo;Letters&rdquo;
between him and many of his friends, which, falling into the
hands of Curll, a rapacious bookseller, of no good fame, were by
him printed and sold.&nbsp; This volume containing some letters
from noblemen, Pope incited a prosecution against him in the
House of Lords for breach of privilege, and attended himself to
stimulate the resentment of his friends.&nbsp; Curll appeared at
the bar, and, knowing himself in no great danger, spoke of Pope
with very little reverence.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has,&rdquo; said
Curll, &ldquo;a knack at versifying, but in prose I think myself
a match for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the orders of the House were
examined, none of them appeared to have been infringed.&nbsp;
Curll went away triumphant, and Pope was left to seek some other
remedy.</p>
<p>Curll&rsquo;s account was, that one evening a man in a
clergyman&rsquo;s gown, but with a lawyer&rsquo;s band, brought
and offered for sale a number of printed volumes, which he found
to be Pope&rsquo;s epistolary correspondence; that he asked no
name, and was told none, but gave the price demanded, and thought
himself authorised to use his purchase to his own
advantage.&nbsp; That Curll gave a true account of the
transaction it is reasonable to believe, because no falsehood was
ever detected; and when, some years afterwards, I mentioned it to
Lintot, the son of Bernard, he declared his opinion to be, that
Pope knew better than anybody else how Curll obtained the copies,
because another parcel was at the same time sent to himself, for
which no price had ever been demanded, as he made known his
resolution not to pay a porter, and consequently not to deal with
a nameless agent.&nbsp; Such care had been taken to make them
public, that they were sent at once to two booksellers; to Curll,
who was likely to seize them as a prey, and to Lintot, who might
he expected to give Pope information of the seeming injury.&nbsp;
Lintot, I believe, did nothing, and Curll did what was
expected.&nbsp; That to make them public was the only purpose may
be reasonably supposed, because the numbers offered to sale by
the private messengers showed that the hope of gain could not
have been the motive of the impression.&nbsp; It seems that Pope,
being desirous of printing his &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; and not
knowing how to do, without imputation of vanity, what has in this
country been done very rarely, contrived an appearance of
compulsion, that, when he could complain that his
&ldquo;Letters&rdquo; were surreptitiously published, he might
decently and defensively publish them himself.</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s private correspondence, thus promulgated, filled
the nation with the praises of his candour, tenderness, and
benevolence, the purity of his purposes, and the fidelity of his
friendship.&nbsp; There were some letters which a very good or a
wise man would wish suppressed; but, as they had been already
exposed, it was impracticable now to retract them.&nbsp; From the
perusal of those letters, Mr. Allen first conceived the desire of
knowing him; and with so much zeal did he cultivate the
friendship which he had newly formed, that, when Pope told his
purpose of vindicating his own property by a genuine edition, he
offered to pay the cost.&nbsp; This, however, Pope did not
accept; but in time solicited a subscription for a quarto volume,
which appeared (1737), I believe, with sufficient profit.&nbsp;
In the preface he tells that his letters were reposited in a
friend&rsquo;s library, said to be the Earl of Oxford&rsquo;s,
and that the copy thence stolen was sent to the press.&nbsp; The
story was doubtless received with different degrees of
credit.&nbsp; It may be suspected that the preface to the
&ldquo;Miscellanies&rdquo; was written to prepare the public for
such an incident; and, to strengthen this opinion, James
Worsdale, a painter, who was employed in clandestine
negotiations, but whose voracity was very doubtful, declared that
he was the messenger who carried, by Pope&rsquo;s direction, the
books to Curll.&nbsp; When they were thus published and avowed,
as they had relation to recent facts, and persons either then
living or not yet forgotten, they may be supposed to have found
readers; but, as the facts were minute, and the characters being
either private or literary, were little known, or little
regarded, they awaked no popular kindness or resentment.&nbsp;
The book never became much the subject of conversation.&nbsp;
Some read it as a contemporary history, and some perhaps as a
model of epistolary language; but those who read it did not talk
of it.&nbsp; Not much therefore was added by it to fame or envy,
nor do I remember that it produced either public praise or public
censure.&nbsp; It had, however, in some degree, the
recommendation of novelty.&nbsp; Our language had few letters,
except those of statesmen.&nbsp; Howel, indeed, about a century
ago, published his &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; which are commended by
Morhoff, and which alone, of his hundred volumes, continue his
memory.&nbsp; Loveday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letters&rdquo; were printed
only once; those of Herbert and Suckling are hardly known.&nbsp;
Mrs. Phillips&rsquo;s (Orinda&rsquo;s) are equally
neglected.&nbsp; And those of Walsh seem written as exercises,
and were never sent to any living mistress or friend.&nbsp;
Pope&rsquo;s epistolary excellence had an open field; he had no
English rival, living or dead.</p>
<p>Pope is seen in this collection as connected with the other
contemporary wits, and certainly suffers no disgrace in the
comparison; but it must be remembered that he had the power of
favouring himself.&nbsp; He might have originally had publication
in his mind, and have written with care, or have afterwards
selected those which he had most happily conceived or most
diligently laboured; and I know not whether there does not appear
something more studied and artificial in his productions than the
rest, except one long letter by Bolingbroke, composed with all
the skill and industry of a professed author.&nbsp; It is indeed
not easy to distinguish affectation from habit; he that has once
studiously formed a style, rarely writes afterwards with complete
ease.&nbsp; Pope may be said to write always with his reputation
in his head; Swift, perhaps, like a man that remembered he was
writing to Pope; but Arbuthnot, like one who lets thoughts drop
from his pen as they rise into his mind.&nbsp; Before these
&ldquo;Letters&rdquo; appeared he published the first part of
what he persuaded himself to think a system of Ethics, under the
title of an &ldquo;Essay on Man,&rdquo; which, if his letter to
Swift (of September 14, 1723), be rightly explained by the
commentator, had been eight years under his consideration, and of
which he seems to have desired the success with great
solicitude.&nbsp; He had now many open, and doubtless many
secret, enemies.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Dunces&rdquo; were yet smarting
from the war, and the superiority which he publicly arrogated
disposed the world to wish his humiliation.&nbsp; All this he
knew, and against all this he provided.&nbsp; His own name, and
that of his friend to whom the work is inscribed, were in the
first editions carefully suppressed; and the poem being of a new
kind was ascribed to one or another as favour determined or
conjecture wandered.&nbsp; It was given, says Warburton, to every
man except him only who could write it.&nbsp; Those who like only
when they like the author, and who are under the dominion of a
name, condemned it, and those admired it who are willing to
scatter praise at random, which, while it is unappropriated,
excites no envy.&nbsp; Those friends of Pope that were trusted
with the secret went about lavishing honours on the new-born
poet, and hinting that Pope was never so much in danger from any
former rival.&nbsp; To those authors whom he had personally
offended, and to those whose opinion the world considered as
decisive, and whom he suspected of envy or malevolence, he sent
his Essay as a present before publication, that they might defeat
their own enemity by praises which they could not afterwards
decently retract.&nbsp; With these precautions, in 1733, was
published the first part of the &ldquo;Essay on Man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There had been for some time a report that Pope was busy upon a
&ldquo;System of Morality,&rdquo; but this design was not
discovered in the new poem, which had a form and a title with
which its readers were unacquainted.&nbsp; Its reception was not
uniform.&nbsp; Some thought it a very imperfect piece, though not
without good lines.&nbsp; While the author was unknown, some, as
will always happen, favoured him as an adventurer, and some
censured him as an intruder, but all thought him above
neglect.&nbsp; The sale increased, and editions were
multiplied.&nbsp; The subsequent editions of the first epistle
exhibited two memorable corrections.&nbsp; At first, the poet and
his friend</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Expatiate freely o&rsquo;er this scene
of man,<br />
A mighty maze <i>of walks without a plan</i>;&rdquo;</p>
<p>for which he wrote afterwards,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;A mighty maze, <i>but not without a
plan</i>;&rdquo;</p>
<p>for if there was no plan it was in vain to describe or to
trace the maze.</p>
<p>The other alteration was of these lines:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And spike of pride, <i>and in thy
reason&rsquo;s spite</i>,<br />
One truth is clear, whatever is, is right:&rdquo;</p>
<p>but having afterwards discovered, or been shown, that the
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; which subsisted &ldquo;in spite of
reason&rdquo; could not be very &ldquo;clear,&rdquo; he
substituted</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And spite of pride <i>in erring
reason&rsquo;s spite</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To such oversights will the most vigorous mind be liable when
it is employed at once upon argument and poetry.</p>
<p>The second and third epistles were published, and Pope was, I
believe, more and more suspected of writing them.&nbsp; At last,
in 1734, he avowed the fourth, and claimed the honour of a moral
poet.&nbsp; In the conclusion it is sufficiently acknowledged
that the doctrine of the &ldquo;Essay on Man&rdquo; was received
from Bolingbroke, who is said to have ridiculed Pope, among those
who enjoyed his confidence, as having adopted and advanced
principles of which he did not perceive the consequence, and as
blindly propagating opinions contrary to his own.&nbsp; That
those communications had been consolidated into a scheme
regularly drawn, and delivered to Pope, from whom it returned
only transformed from prose to verse, has been reported, but
hardly can be true.&nbsp; The essay plainly appears the fabric of
a poet; what Bolingbroke supplied could be only the first
principles, the order, illustration, and embellishments, must all
be Pope&rsquo;s.&nbsp; These principles it is not my business to
clear from obscurity, dogmatism, or falsehood, but they were not
immediately examined.&nbsp; Philosophy and poetry have not often
the same readers; and the essay abounded in splendid
amplifications and sparkling sentences, which were read and
admired with no great attention to their ultimate purpose.&nbsp;
Its flowers caught the eye, which did not see what the gay
foliage concealed, and for a time flourished in the sunshine of
universal approbation.&nbsp; So little was any evil tendency
discovered, that, as innocence is unsuspicious, many read it for
a manual of piety.&nbsp; Its reputation soon invited a
translator.&nbsp; It was first turned into French prose, and
afterwards by Resnel into verse.&nbsp; Both translations fell
into the hands of Crousaz, who first, when he had the version in
prose, wrote a general censure, and afterwards reprinted
Resnel&rsquo;s version, with particular remarks upon every
paragraph.</p>
<p>Crousaz was a professor of Switzerland, eminent for his
treatise of logic, and his &ldquo;Examen de Pyrrhonisme,&rdquo;
and, however little known or regarded here, was no mean
antagonist.&nbsp; His mind was one of those in which philosophy
and piety are happily united.&nbsp; He was accustomed to argument
and disquisition, and perhaps was grown too desirous of detecting
faults, but his intentions were always right, his opinions were
solid, and his religion pure.&nbsp; His incessant vigilance for
the promotion of piety disposed him to look with distrust upon
all metaphysical systems of theology, and all schemes of virtue
and happiness purely rational; and therefore it was not long
before he was persuaded that the positions of Pope, as they
terminated for the most part in natural religion, were intended
to draw mankind away from revelation, and to represent the whole
course of things as a necessary concatenation of indissoluble
fatality, and it is undeniable that in many passages a religious
eye may easily discover expressions not very favourable to morals
or to liberty.</p>
<p>About this time Warburton began to make his appearance in the
first ranks of learning.&nbsp; He was a man of vigorous
faculties, a mind fervid and vehement, supplied by incessant and
unlimited inquiry, with wonderful extent and variety of
knowledge, which yet had not oppressed his imagination nor
clouded his perspicacity.&nbsp; To every work he brought a memory
full fraught, together with a fancy fertile of original
combinations and at once exerted the powers of the scholar, the
reasoner, and the wit.&nbsp; But his knowledge was too
multifarious to be always exact, and his pursuits were too eager
to be always cautions.&nbsp; His abilities gave him a haughty
confidence, which he disdained to conceal or mollify, and his
impatience of opposition disposed him to treat his adversaries
with such contemptuous superiority as made his readers commonly
his enemies, and excited against the advocate the wishes of some
who favoured the cause.&nbsp; He seems to have adopted the Roman
Emperor&rsquo;s determination, <i>oderint dum metuant</i>; he
used no allurements of gentle language, but wished to compel
rather than persuade.&nbsp; His style is copious without
selection, and forcible without neatness.&nbsp; He took the words
that presented themselves.&nbsp; His diction is coarse and
impure, and his sentences are unmeasured.&nbsp; He had in the
early part of his life pleased himself with the notice of
inferior wits, and corresponded with the enemies of Pope.&nbsp; A
letter was produced, when he had perhaps himself forgotten it, in
which he tells Concanen, &ldquo;Dryden, I observe, borrows for
want of leisure, and Pope for want of genius, Milton out of
pride, and Addison out of modesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when Theobald
published Shakespeare, in opposition to Pope, the best notes were
supplied by Warburton.&nbsp; But the time was now come when
Warburton was to change his opinion, and Pope was to find a
defender in him who had contributed so much to the exaltation of
his rival.</p>
<p>The arrogance of Warburton excited against him every artifice
of offence, and therefore it may be supposed that his union with
Pope was censured as hypocritical inconstancy, but surely to
think differently at different times of poetical merit may be
easily allowed.&nbsp; Such opinions are often admitted, and
dismissed without nice examination.&nbsp; Who is there that has
not found reason for changing his mind about questions of greater
importance?</p>
<p>Warburton, whatever was his motive, undertook, without
solicitation, to rescue Pope from the talons of Crousaz, by
freeing him from the imputation of favouring fatality or
rejecting revelation; and from month to month continued a
vindication of the &ldquo;Essay on Man,&rdquo; in the literary
journal of that time called the &ldquo;Republic of
Letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pope, who probably began to doubt the tendency of his own
work, was glad that the positions, of which he perceived himself
not to know the full meaning, could by any mode of interpretation
be made to mean well.&nbsp; How much he was pleased with his
gratuitous defender the following letter evidently
shows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;April 11,
1739.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just
received from Mr. R. two more of your letters.&nbsp; It is in the
greatest hurry imaginable that I write this; but I cannot help
thanking you in particular for your third letter, which is so
extremely clear, short, and full, that I think Mr. Crousaz ought
never to have another answer, and deserved not so good an
one.&nbsp; I can only say, you do him too much honour, and me too
much right, so odd as the expression seems; for you have made my
system as clear as I ought to have done, and could not.&nbsp; It
is indeed the same system as mine, but illustrated with a ray of
your own, as they say our natural body is the same still when it
is glorified.&nbsp; I am sure I like it better than I did before,
and so will every man else.&nbsp; I know I meant just what you
explain; but I did not explain my own meaning so well as
you.&nbsp; You understand me as well as I do myself; but you
express me better than I could express myself.&nbsp; Pray accept
the sincerest acknowledgments.&nbsp; I cannot but wish these
letters were put together in one book, and intend (with your
leave) to procure a translation of part at least, or of all of
them, into French; but I shall not proceed a step without your
consent and opinion,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By this fond and eager acceptance of an exculpatory comment
Pope testified that, whatever might be the seeming or real import
of the principles which he had received from Bolingbroke, he had
not intentionally attacked religion; and Bolingbroke, if he meant
to make him, without his own consent, an instrument of mischief,
found him now engaged, with his eyes open, on the side of
truth.&nbsp; It is known that Bolingbroke concealed from Pope his
real opinions.&nbsp; He once discovered them to Mr. Hooke, who
related them again to Pope, and was told by him that he must have
mistaken the meaning of what he heard: and Bolingbroke, when
Pope&rsquo;s uneasiness incited him to desire an explanation,
declared that Hooke had misunderstood him.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke hated Warburton, who had drawn his pupil from him;
and a little before Pope&rsquo;s death they had a dispute, from
which they parted with mutual aversion.&nbsp; From this time Pope
lived in the closest intimacy with his commentator, and amply
rewarded his kindness and his zeal, for he introduced him to Mr.
Murray, by whose interest he became preacher at Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn, and to Mr. Allen, who gave him his niece and his estate, and
by consequence a bishopric.&nbsp; When he died, he left him the
property of his works, a legacy which may be reasonably estimated
at four thousand pounds.</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s fondness for the &ldquo;Essay on Man&rdquo;
appeared by his desire of its propagation.&nbsp; Dobson, who had
gained reputation by his version of Prior&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; was employed by him to translate it into
Latin verse, and was for that purpose some time at Twickenham;
but he left his work, whatever was the reason, unfinished; and,
by Benson&rsquo;s invitation, undertook the longer task of
&ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pope then desired his friend
to find a scholar who should turn his essay into Latin prose; but
no such performance has ever appeared.</p>
<p>Pope lived at this time <i>among the great</i>, with that
reception and respect to which his works entitled him, and which
he had not impaired by any private misconduct or factious
partiality.&nbsp; Though Bolingbroke was his friend, Walpole was
not his enemy, but treated him with so much consideration as, at
his request, to solicit and obtain from the French Minister an
abbey for Mr. Southcot, whom he considered himself as obliged to
reward, by his exertion of his interest, for the benefit which he
had received from his attendance in a long illness.&nbsp; It was
said, that when the Court was at Richmond, Queen Caroline had
declared her intention to visit him.&nbsp; This may have been
only a careless effusion, thought on no more.&nbsp; The report of
such notice, however, was soon in many mouths; and, if I do not
forget or misapprehend Savage&rsquo;s account, Pope, pretending
to decline what was not yet offered, left his house for a time,
not, I suppose, for any other reason than lest he should be
thought to stay at home in expectation of an honour which would
not be conferred.&nbsp; He was therefore angry at Swift, who
represents him as &ldquo;refusing the visits of a queen,&rdquo;
because he knew that what had never been offered had never been
refused.</p>
<p>Beside the general system of morality, supposed to be
contained in the &ldquo;Essay on Man,&rdquo; it was his intention
to write distinct poems upon the different duties or conditions
of life, one of which is the &ldquo;Epistle to Lord
Bathurst&rdquo; (1733) on the &ldquo;Use of Riches,&rdquo; a
piece on which he declared great labour to have been
bestowed.&nbsp; Into this poem some hints are historically
thrown, and some known characters are introduced, with others of
which it is difficult to say how far they are real or fictitious:
but the praise of Kryle, the Man of Ross, deserves particular
examination, who, after a long and pompous enumeration of his
public works and private charities, is said to have diffused all
those blessings from five hundred a year.&nbsp; Wonders are
willingly told and willingly heard.&nbsp; The truth is, that
Kyrle was a man of known integrity and active benevolence, by
whose solicitation the wealthy were persuaded to pay
contributions to his charitable schemes.&nbsp; This influence he
obtained by an example of liberality exerted to the utmost extent
of his power, and was thus enabled to give more than he
had.&nbsp; This account Mr. Victor received from the minister of
the place, and I have preserved it, that the praise of a good
man, being made more credible, may be more solid.&nbsp;
Narrations of romantic and impracticable virtue will be read with
wonder, but that which is unattainable is recommended in vain;
that good may be endeavoured it must be shown to be
possible.&nbsp; This is the only piece in which the author has
given a hint of his religion, by ridiculing the ceremony of
burning the Pope, and by mentioning with some indignation the
inscription on the Monument.</p>
<p>When this poem was first published, the dialogue having no
letters of direction was perplexed and obscure.&nbsp; Pope seems
to have written with no very distinct idea, for he calls that an
&ldquo;Epistle to Bathurst,&rdquo; in which Bathurst is
introduced as speaking.&nbsp; He afterwards (1734) inscribed to
Lord Cobham his &ldquo;Characters of Men,&rdquo; written with
close attention to the operations of the mind and modifications
of life.&nbsp; In this poem he has endeavoured to establish and
exemplify his favourite theory of the <i>ruling passion</i>, by
which he means an original direction of desire to some particular
object, an innate affection which gives all action a determinate
and invariable tendency, and operates upon the whole system of
life, either openly, cut more secretly by the intervention of
some accidental or subordinate propension.&nbsp; Of any passion,
thus innate and irresistible, the existence may reasonably be
doubted.&nbsp; Human characters are by no means constant; men
change by change of place, of fortune, of acquaintance.&nbsp; He
who is at one time a lover of pleasure, is at another a lover of
money.&nbsp; Those, indeed, who attain any excellence commonly
spend life in one pursuit, for excellence is not often gained
upon easier terms.&nbsp; But to the particular species of
excellence men are directed, not by an ascendant planet or
predominating humour, but by the first book which they read, some
early conversation which they heard, or some accident which
excited ardour and emulation.&nbsp; It must at least be allowed
that this ruling passion, antecedent to reason and observation,
must have an object independent on human contrivance, for there
can be no natural desire of artificial good.&nbsp; No man,
therefore, can be born, in the strict acceptation, a lover of
money, for he may be born where money does not exist; nor can he
be born in a moral sense a lover of his country, for society
politically regulated is a state contradistinguished from a state
of nature, and any attention to that coalition of interests which
makes the happiness of a country is possible only to those whom
inquiry and reflection have enabled to comprehend it.&nbsp; This
doctrine is in itself pernicious as well as false; its tendency
is to produce the belief of a kind of moral predestination or
over-ruling principle which cannot be resisted.&nbsp; He that
admits it is prepared to comply with every desire that caprice or
opportunity shall excite, and to flatter himself that he submits
only to the lawful dominion of nature in obeying the resistless
authority of his ruling passion.</p>
<p>Pope has formed his theory with so little skill that in the
examples by which he illustrates and confirms it he has
confounded passions, appetites, and habits.&nbsp; To the
&ldquo;Characters of Men&rdquo; he added soon after, in an
epistle supposed to have been addressed to Martha Blount, but
which the last edition has taken from her, the &ldquo;Characters
of Women.&rdquo;&nbsp; This poem, which was laboured with great
diligence and in the author&rsquo;s opinion with great success,
was neglected at its first publication, as the commentator
supposes, because the public was informed by an advertisement
that it contained no character drawn from the life, an assertion
which Pope probably did not expect nor wished to have been
believed, and which he soon gave his readers sufficient reason to
distrust, by telling them in a note that the work was imperfect
because part of his subject was vice too high to be yet
exposed.&nbsp; The time, however, soon came in which it was safe
to display the Duchess of Marlborough under the name of Atossa,
and her character was inserted with no great honour to the
writer&rsquo;s gratitude.</p>
<p>He published from time to time (between 1730 and 1740)
imitations of different poems of Horace, generally with his name,
and once, as was suspected, without it.&nbsp; What he was upon
moral principles ashamed to own he ought to have
suppressed.&nbsp; Of these pieces it is useless to settle the
dates, as they had seldom much relation to the times, and perhaps
had been long in his hands.&nbsp; This mode of imitation, in
which the ancients are familiarised by adapting their sentiments
to modern topics, by making Horace say of Shakespeare what he
originally said of Ennius, and accommodating his satires on
Pantolabus and Nomentanus to the flatterers and prodigals of our
own time, was first practised in the reign of Charles the Second,
by Oldham and Rochester, at least I remember no instances more
ancient.&nbsp; It is a kind of middle composition between
translation and original design, which pleases when the thoughts
are unexpectedly applicable, and the parallels lucky.&nbsp; It
seems to have been Pope&rsquo;s favourite amusement, for he has
carried it farther than any former poet.&nbsp; He published
likewise a revival, in smoother numbers, of Dr. Donne&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Satires,&rdquo; which was recommended to him by the Duke
of Shrewsbury and the Earl of Oxford.&nbsp; They made no great
impression on the public.&nbsp; Pope seems to have known their
imbecility and therefore suppressed them while he was yet
contending to rise in reputation, but ventured them when he
thought their deficiencies more likely to be imputed to Donne
than to himself.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,&rdquo; which seems to be
derived in its first design from Boileau&rsquo;s Address
<i>&agrave; son Esprit</i>, was published in January, 1735, about
a month before the death of him to whom it is inscribed.&nbsp; It
is to be regretted that either honour or pleasure should have
been missed by Arbuthnot, a man estimable for his learning,
amiable for his life, and venerable for his piety.&nbsp;
Arbuthnot was a man of great comprehension, skilful in his
profession, versed in the sciences, acquainted with ancient
literature, and able to animate his mass of knowledge by a bright
and active imagination; a scholar with great brilliance of wit, a
wit who, in the crowd of life, retained and discovered a noble
ardour of religious zeal.&nbsp; In this poem Pope seems to reckon
with the public.&nbsp; He vindicates himself from censures, and
with dignity rather than arrogance enforces his own claims to
kindness and respect.&nbsp; Into this poem are interwoven several
paragraphs which had been before printed, as a fragment, and
among them the satirical lines upon Addison, of which the last
couplet has been twice corrected.&nbsp; It was at
first&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Who would not smile if such a man there
be?<br />
Who would not laugh if Addison were he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Who would not grieve if such a man there
be?<br />
Who would not laugh if Addison were he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last it is&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Who but must laugh if such a man there
he?<br />
Who would not weep if Atticus were he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was at this time at open war with Lord Hervey, who had
distinguished himself as a steady adherent to the ministry, and
being offended with a contemptuous answer to one of his
pamphlets, had summoned Pulteney to a duel.&nbsp; Whether he or
Pope made the first attack perhaps cannot now be easily
known.&nbsp; He had written an invective against Pope, whom he
calls, &ldquo;Hard as thy heart, and as thy birth obscure;&rdquo;
and hints that his father was a hatter.&nbsp; To this Pope wrote
a reply in verse and prose.&nbsp; The verses are in this poem,
and the prose, though it was never sent, is printed among his
letters; but to a cool reader of the present time exhibits
nothing but tedious malignity.</p>
<p>His last &ldquo;Satires&rdquo; of the general kind, were two
Dialogues, named, from the year in which they were published,
&ldquo;Seventeen hundred and thirty-eight.&rdquo;&nbsp; In these
poems many are praised and many reproached.&nbsp; Pope was then
entangled in the opposition, a follower of the Prince of Wales,
who dined at his house, and the friend of many who obstructed and
censured the conduct of the ministers.&nbsp; His political
partiality was too plainly shown; he forgot the prudence with
which he passed, in his earlier years, uninjured and unoffending,
through much more violent conflicts of faction.&nbsp; In the
first Dialogue, having an opportunity of praising Allen of Bath,
he asked his leave to mention him as a man not illustrious by any
merit of his ancestors, and called him in his verses
&ldquo;low-born Allen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men are seldom satisfied with
praise introduced or followed by any mention of defect.&nbsp;
Allen seems not to have taken any pleasure in his epithet, which
was afterwards softened into &ldquo;humble Allen.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
the second Dialogue he took some liberty with one of the Foxes
among others; which Fox in a reply to Lyttelton, took an
opportunity of repaying, by reproaching him with the friendship
of a lampooner, who scattered his ink without fear or decency,
and against whom he hoped the resentment of the Legislature would
quickly be discharged.</p>
<p>About this time Paul Whitehead, a small poet, was summoned
before the Lords for a poem called &ldquo;Manners,&rdquo;
together with Dodsley, his publisher.&nbsp; Whitehead, who hung
loose upon society, skulked and escaped, but Dodsley&rsquo;s shop
and family made his appearance necessary.&nbsp; He was, however,
soon dismissed, and the whole process was probably intended
rather to intimidate Pope than to punish Whitehead.</p>
<p>Pope never afterwards attempted to join the patriot with the
poet, nor drew his pen upon statesmen.&nbsp; That he desisted
from his attempts of reformation is imputed by his commentator to
his despair of prevailing over the corruption of the time.&nbsp;
He was not likely to have been ever of opinion that the dread of
his satire would countervail the love of power or of money; he
pleased himself with being important and formidable, and
gratified sometimes his pride, and sometimes his resentment, till
at last he began to think he should be more safe if he were less
busy.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Memoirs of Scriblerus,&rdquo; published about this
time, extend only to the first book of a work projected in
concert by Pope, Swift, and Arbuthnot, who used to meet on the
time of Queen Anne, and denominated themselves the
&ldquo;Scriblerus Club.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their purpose was to censure
the abuses of learning by a fictitious life of an infatuated
scholar.&nbsp; They were dispersed; the design was never
completed, and Warburton laments its miscarriage as an event very
disastrous to polite letters.&nbsp; If the whole may be estimated
by this specimen, which seems to be the production of Arbuthnot,
with a few touches perhaps by Pope, the want of more will not be
much lamented; for the follies which the writer ridicules are so
little practised that they are not known; nor can the satire be
understood but by the learned.&nbsp; He raises phantoms of
absurdity, and then drives them away.&nbsp; He cures diseases
that were never felt.&nbsp; For this reason this joint production
of three great writers has never obtained any notice from
mankind.&nbsp; It has been little read, or when read has been
forgotten, as no man could be wiser, better, or merrier, by
remembering it.&nbsp; The design cannot boast of much
originality; for, besides its general resemblance to &ldquo;Don
Quixote,&rdquo; there will be found in it particular imitations
of the &ldquo;History of Mr. Ouffle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swift carried so much of it into Ireland as supplied him with
hints for his &ldquo;Travels;&rdquo; and with those the world
might have been contented, though the rest had been
suppressed.</p>
<p>Pope had sought for images and sentiments in a region not
known to have been explored by many other of the English
writers.&nbsp; He had consulted the modern writers of Latin
poetry, a class of authors whom Boileau endeavoured to bring into
contempt, and who are too generally neglected.&nbsp; Pope,
however, was not ashamed of their acquaintance, nor ungrateful
for the advantages which he might have derived from it.&nbsp; A
small selection from the Italians, who wrote in Latin, had been
published at London, about the latter end of the last century, by
a man who concealed his name, but whom his preface shows to have
been qualified for his undertaking.&nbsp; This collection Pope
amplified by more than half, and (1740) published it in two
volumes, but injuriously omitted his predecessor&rsquo;s
preface.&nbsp; To these books, which had nothing but the mere
text, no regard was paid; the authors were still neglected, and
the editor was neither praised nor censured.&nbsp; He did not
sink into idleness; he had planned a work, which he considered as
subsequent to his &ldquo;Essay on Man,&rdquo; of which he has
given this account to Dr. Swift:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;March 25,
1736.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I write any more Epistles in verse, one of them
shall be addressed to you.&nbsp; I have long concerted it and
begun it; but I would make what bears your name as finished as my
last work ought to be, that is to say, more finished than any of
the rest.&nbsp; The subject is large, and will divide into four
Epistles, which naturally follow the &lsquo;Essay on Man,&rsquo;
viz: 1.&nbsp; Of the Extent and Limits of Human Reason and
Science.&nbsp; 2. A view of the useful and therefore attainable,
and of the unuseful and therefore unattainable Arts.&nbsp; 3. Of
the Nature, Ends, Application, and Use, of different
Capacities.&nbsp; 4. Of the Use of Learning, of the Science, of
the World, and of Wit.&nbsp; It will conclude with a satire
against the misapplication of all these, exemplified by Pictures,
Characters, and Examples.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work in its full extent&mdash;being now afflicted with an
asthma, and finding the powers of life gradually
declining&mdash;he had no longer courage to undertake; but, from
the materials which he had provided, he added, at
Warburton&rsquo;s request, another book to the
&ldquo;Dunciad,&rdquo; of which the design is to ridicule such
studies as are either hopeless or useless, as either pursue what
is unattainable, or what, if it be attained, is of no use.&nbsp;
When this book was printed (1742) the laurel had been for some
time upon the head of Cibber, a man whom it cannot be supposed
that Pope could regard with much kindness or esteem, though in
one of the imitations of Horace he has liberally enough praised
the &ldquo;Careless Husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;Dunciad,&rdquo; among other worthless scribblers, he had
mentioned Cibber, who, in his &ldquo;Apology,&rdquo; complains of
the great Poet&rsquo;s unkindness as more injurious,
&ldquo;because,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I never have offended
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might have been expected that Pope should have been in some
degree mollified by this submissive gentleness, but no such
consequence appeared.&nbsp; Though he condescended to commend
Cibber once, he mentioned him afterwards contemptuously in one of
his satires, and again in his &ldquo;Epistle to Arbuthnot,&rdquo;
and in the fourth book of the &ldquo;Dunciad&rdquo; attacked him
with acrimony, to which the provocation is not easily
discoverable.&nbsp; Perhaps he imagined that, in ridiculing the
Laureate, he satirised those by whom the laurel had been given,
and gratified that ambitious petulance with which he affected to
insult the great.&nbsp; The severity of this satire left Cibber
no longer any patience.&nbsp; He had confidence enough in his own
powers to believe that he could disturb the quiet of his
adversary, and doubtless did not want instigators, who, without
any care about the victory, desired to amuse themselves by
looking on the contest.&nbsp; He therefore gave the town a
pamphlet, in which he declares his resolution from that time
never to bear another blow without returning it, and to tire out
his adversary by perseverance if he cannot conquer him by
strength.</p>
<p>The incessant and unappeasable malignity of Pope he imputes to
a very distant cause.&nbsp; After the <i>Three Hours After
Marriage</i> had been driven off the stage, by the offence which
the mummy and crocodile gave the audience, while the exploded
scene was yet fresh in memory, it happened that Cibber played
Bayes in the <i>Rehearsal</i>; and, as it had been usual to
enliven the part by the mention of any recent theatrical
transactions, he said, that he once thought to have introduced
his lovers disguised in a mummy and a crocodile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;was received with loud claps,
which indicated contempt for the play.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pope, who was
behind the scenes, meeting him as he left the stage, attacked
him, as he says, with all the virulence of a &ldquo;wit out of
his senses;&rdquo; to which he replied, &ldquo;that he would take
no other notice of what was said by so particular a man, than to
declare, that as often as he played that part he would repeat the
same provocation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shows his opinion to be that
Pope was one of the authors of the play which he so zealously
defended, and adds an idle story of Pope&rsquo;s behaviour at a
tavern.</p>
<p>The pamphlet was written with little power of thought or
language, and, if suffered to remain without notice, would have
been very soon forgotten.&nbsp; Pope had now been enough
acquainted with human life to know, if his passion had not been
too powerful for his understanding, that, from a contention like
his with Cibber, the world seeks nothing but diversion, which is
given at the expense of the higher character.&nbsp; When Cibber
lampooned Pope, curiosity was excited.&nbsp; What Pope would say
of Cibber nobody inquired, but in hope that Pope&rsquo;s asperity
might betray his pain and lessen his dignity.&nbsp; He should
therefore have suffered the pamphlet to flutter and die, without
confessing that it stung him.&nbsp; The dishonour of being shown
as Cibber&rsquo;s antagonist could never be compensated by the
victory.&nbsp; Cibber had nothing to lose.&nbsp; When Pope had
exhausted all his malignity upon him, he would rise in the esteem
both of his friends and his enemies.&nbsp; Silence only could
have made him despicable; the blow which did not appear to be
felt would have been struck in vain.&nbsp; But Pope&rsquo;s
irascibility prevailed, and he resolved to tell the whole English
world that he was at war with Cibber; and, to show that he
thought him to common adversary, he prepared no common
vengeance.&nbsp; He published a new edition of the
&ldquo;Dunciad,&rdquo; in which he degraded Theobald from his
painful pre-eminence, and enthroned Cibber in his stead.&nbsp;
Unhappily the two heroes were of opposite characters, and Pope
was unwilling to lose what he had already written.&nbsp; He has
therefore depraved his poem by giving to Cibber the old books,
the old pedantry, and the sluggish pertinacity of Theobald.</p>
<p>Pope was ignorant enough of his own interest to make another
change, and introduced Osborne contending for a prize among the
booksellers.&nbsp; Osborne was a man entirely destitute of shame,
without sense of any disgrace but that of poverty.&nbsp; He told
me, when he was doing that which raised Pope&rsquo;s resentment,
that he should be put into the &ldquo;Dunciad;&rdquo; but he had
the fate of Cassandra.&nbsp; I gave no credit to his prediction,
till in time I saw it accomplished.&nbsp; The shafts of satire
were directed equally in vain against Cibber and Osborne; being
repelled by the impenetrable impudence of one, and deadened by
the impassive dulness of the other.&nbsp; Pope confessed his own
pain by his anger; but he gave no pain to those who had provoked
him.&nbsp; He was able to hurt none but himself; by transferring
the same ridicule from one to another, he reduced himself to the
insignificance of his own magpie, who from his cage calls cuckold
at a venture.</p>
<p>Cibber, according to his engagement, repaid the
&ldquo;Dunciad&rdquo; with another pamphlet, which, Pope said,
&ldquo;would be as good as a dose of hartshorn to him;&rdquo; but
his tongue and his heart were at variance.&nbsp; I have heard Mr.
Richardson relate that he attended his father the painter on a
visit, when one of Cibber&rsquo;s pamphlets came into the hands
of Pope, who said, &ldquo;These things are my
diversion.&rdquo;&nbsp; They sat by him while he perused it, and
saw his features writhing with anguish: and young Richardson said
to his father, when they returned, that he hoped to be preserved
from such diversion as had been that day the lot of Pope.&nbsp;
From this time, finding his diseases more oppressive, and his
vital powers gradually declining, he no longer strained his
faculties with any original composition, nor proposed any other
employment for his remaining life than the revisal and correction
of his former works, in which he received advice and assistance
from Warburton, whom he appears to have trusted and honoured in
the highest degree.&nbsp; He laid aside his Epic Poem, perhaps
without much loss to mankind; for his hero was Brutus the Trojan,
who, according to a ridiculous fiction, established a colony in
Britain.&nbsp; The subject, therefore, was of the fabulous age;
the actors were a race upon whom imagination has been exhausted,
and attention wearied, and to whom the mind will not easily be
recalled, when it is invited in blank verse, which Pope had
adopted with great imprudence, and, I think, without due
consideration of the nature of our language.&nbsp; The sketch is,
at least in part, preserved by Ruffhead, by which it appears that
Pope was thoughtless enough to model the names of his heroes with
terminations not consistent with the time or country in which he
places them.&nbsp; He lingered through the next year, but
perceived himself, as he expresses it, &ldquo;going down the
hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had for at least five years been afflicted
with an asthma, and other disorders, which his physicians were
unable to relieve.&nbsp; Towards the end of his life he consulted
Dr. Thomson, a man who had, by large promises, and free censures
of the common practice of physic, forced himself up into sudden
reputation.&nbsp; Thomson declared his distemper to be a dropsy,
and evacuated part of the water by tincture of jalap, but
confessed that his belly did not subside.&nbsp; Thomson had many
enemies, and Pope was persuaded to dismiss him.</p>
<p>While he was yet capable of amusement and conversation, as he
was one day sitting in the air with Lord Bolingbroke and Lord
Marchmont, he saw his favourite Martha Blount at the bottom of
the terrace, and asked Lord Bolingbroke to go and hand her
up.&nbsp; Bolingbroke, not liking his errand, crossed his legs
and sat still; but Lord Marchmont, who was younger and less
captious, waited on the lady, who, when he came to her, asked,
&ldquo;What, is he not dead yet?&rdquo;&nbsp; She is said to have
neglected him with shameful unkindness, in the latter time of his
decay; yet, of the little which he had to leave she had a very
great part.&nbsp; Their acquaintance began early; the life of
each was pictured on the other&rsquo;s mind; their conversation
therefore was endearing, for when they met, there was an
immediate coalition of congenial notions.&nbsp; Perhaps he
considered her unwillingness to approach the chamber of sickness
as female weakness, or human frailty; perhaps he was conscious to
himself of peevishness and impatience, or, though he was offended
by her inattention, might yet consider her merit as overbalancing
her fault; and if he had suffered his heart to be alienated from
her, he could have found nothing that might fill her place; he
could have only shrunk within himself.&nbsp; It was too late to
transfer his confidence or fondness.</p>
<p>In May, 1744, his death was approaching.&nbsp; On the 6th he
was all day delirious, which he mentioned for days afterwards as
a sufficient humiliation of the vanity of man; he afterwards
complained of seeing things as through a curtain, and in false
colours, and one day, its the presence of Dodsley, asked what arm
it was that came from the wall.&nbsp; He said that his greatest
inconvenience was inability to think.&nbsp; Bolingbroke sometimes
wept over him in this state of helpless decay; and being told by
Spence, that Pope, at the intermission of his deliriousness, was
always saying something kind either of his present or absent
friends, and that his humanity seemed to have survived his
understanding, answered, &ldquo;It has so.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
added, &ldquo;I never in my life knew a man that had so tender a
heart for his particular friends, or more general friendship for
mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time he said, &ldquo;I have
known Pope these thirty years, and value myself more in his
friendship than&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; His grief then suppressed his
voice.</p>
<p>Pope expressed undoubting confidence of a future state.&nbsp;
Being asked by his friend Mr. Hooke, a papist, whether he would
not die like his father and mother, and whether a priest should
not be called, he answered, &ldquo;I do not think it essential,
but it will be very right; and I thank you for putting me in mind
of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the morning, after the priest had given
him the last sacraments, he said &ldquo;There is nothing that is
meritorious but virtue and friendship; and indeed friendship
itself is only a part of virtue.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in the
evening of the 30th day of May 1744, so placidly, that the
attendants did not discern the exact time of his
expiration.&nbsp; He was buried at Twickenham, near his father
and mother, where a monument has been erected to him by his
commentator, the Bishop of Gloucester.</p>
<p>He left the care of his papers to his executors; first to Lord
Bolingbroke, and, if he should not be living, to the Earl of
Marchmont, undoubtedly expecting them to be proud of the trust,
and eager to extend his fame.&nbsp; But let no man dream of
influence beyond his life.&nbsp; After a decent time Dodsley, the
bookseller, went to solicit preference as the publisher, and was
told that the parcel had not been yet inspected; and, whatever
was the reason, the world has been disappointed of what was
&ldquo;reserved for the next age.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lost, indeed,
the favour of Bolingbroke by a kind of posthumous offence.&nbsp;
The political pamphlet called &ldquo;The Patriot King&rdquo; had
been put into his hands that he might procure the impression of a
very few copies, to be distributed, according to the
author&rsquo;s direction, among his friends, and Pope assured him
that no more had been printed than were allowed; but, soon after
his death, the printer brought and resigned a complete edition of
fifteen hundred copies, which Pope had ordered him to print and
retain in secret.&nbsp; He kept, as was observed, his engagement
to Pope better than Pope had kept it to his friend; and nothing
was known of the transaction till, upon the death of his
employer, he thought himself obliged to deliver the books to the
right owner, who, with great indignation, made a fire in his
yard, and delivered the whole impression to the flames.</p>
<p>Hitherto nothing had been done which was not naturally
dictated by resentment of violated faith; resentment more
acrimonious, as the violator had been more loved or more
trusted.&nbsp; But here the anger might have stopped; the injury
was private, and there was little danger from the example.&nbsp;
Bolingbroke, however, was not yet satisfied.&nbsp; His thirst of
vengeance excited him to blast the memory of the man over whom he
had wept in his last struggles; and he employed Mallet, another
friend of Pope, to tell the tale to the public, with all its
aggravations.&nbsp; Warburton, whose heart was warm with his
legacy and tender by the recent separation, thought it proper for
him to interpose, and undertook, not indeed to vindicate the
action, for breach of trust has always something criminal, but to
extenuate it by an apology.&nbsp; Having advanced what cannot be
denied, that moral obliquity is made more or less excusable by
the motives that produce it, he inquires what evil purpose could
have induced Pope to break his promise.&nbsp; He could not
delight his vanity by usurping the work, which, though not sold
in shops, had been shown to a number more than sufficient to
preserve the author&rsquo;s claim; he could not gratify his
avarice, for he could not sell his plunder till Bolingbroke was
dead; and even then, if the copy was left to another, his fraud
would be defeated, and if left to himself would be useless.</p>
<p>Warburton therefore supposes, with great appearance of reason,
that the irregularity of his conduct proceeded wholly from his
zeal for Bolingbroke, who might perhaps have destroyed the
pamphlet, which Pope thought it his duty to preserve, even
without its author&rsquo;s approbation.&nbsp; To this apology an
answer was written in &ldquo;A letter to the most impudent man
living.&rdquo;&nbsp; He brought some reproach upon his own memory
by the petulant and contemptuous mention made in his will of Mr.
Allen and an affected repayment of his benefactions.&nbsp; Mrs.
Blount, as the known friend and favourite of Pope, had been
invited to the house of Allen, where she comported herself with
such indecent arrogance that she parted from Mrs. Allen in a
state of irreconcilable dislike, and the door was for ever barred
against her.&nbsp; This exclusion she resented with so much
bitterness as to refuse any legacy from Pope unless he left the
world with a disavowal of obligation to Allen.&nbsp; Having been
long under her dominion, now tottering in the decline of life,
and unable to resist the violence of her temper, or perhaps, with
the prejudice of a lover, persuaded that she had suffered
improper treatment, he complied with her demand, and polluted his
will with female resentment.&nbsp; Allen accepted the legacy,
which he gave to the hospital at Bath, observing that Pope was
always a bad accountant, and that if to &pound;150 he had put a
cipher more he had come nearer to the truth.</p>
<p>The person of Pope is well known not to have been formed by
the nicest model.&nbsp; He has, in his account of the
&ldquo;Little Club,&rdquo; compared himself to a spider, and by
another is described as protuberant behind and before.&nbsp; He
is said to have been beautiful in his infancy, but he was of a
constitution originally feeble and weak; and, as bodies of a
tender frame are easily distorted, his deformity was probably in
part the effect of his application.&nbsp; His stature was so low,
that to bring him to a level with common tables, it was necessary
to raise his seat.&nbsp; But his face was not displeasing, and
his eyes were animated and vivid.&nbsp; By natural deformity, or
accidental distortion, his vital functions were so much
disordered, that his life was &ldquo;a long disease.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His most frequent assailant was the headache, which he used to
relieve by inhaling the steam of coffee, which he very frequently
required.</p>
<p>Most of what can be told concerning his petty peculiarities
was communicated by a female domestic of the Earl of Oxford, who
knew him perhaps after the middle of life.&nbsp; He was then so
weak as to stand in perpetual need of female attendance;
extremely sensible of cold, so that he wore a kind of fur
doublet, under a shirt of a very coarse warm linen with fine
sleeves.&nbsp; When he rose, he was invested in bodice made of
stiff canvas, being scarcely able to hold himself erect till they
were laced, and he then put on a flannel waistcoat.&nbsp; One
side was contracted.&nbsp; His legs were so slender, that he
enlarged their bulk with three pairs of stockings, which were
drawn on and off by the maid, for he was not able to dress or
undress himself, and neither went to bed nor rose without
help.&nbsp; His weakness made it very difficult for him to be
clean.&nbsp; His hair had fallen almost all away, and he used to
dine sometimes with Lord Oxford, privately, in a velvet
cap.&nbsp; His dress of ceremony was black, with a tie-wig, and a
little sword.&nbsp; The indulgence and accommodation which his
sickness required, had taught him all the unpleasing and unsocial
qualities of a valetudinary man.&nbsp; He expected that
everything should give way to his ease or humour, as a child,
whose parents will not hear her cry, has an unresisted dominion
in the nursery.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;est que l&rsquo;enfant toujours est
homme,<br />
C&rsquo;est que l&rsquo;homme est toujours enfant.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he wanted to sleep he &ldquo;nodded in company,&rdquo;
and once slumbered at his own table while the Prince of Wales was
talking of poetry.</p>
<p>The reputation which his friendship gave procured him many
invitations, but he was a very troublesome inmate.&nbsp; He
brought no servant, and had so many wants, that a numerous
attendance was scarcely able to supply them.&nbsp; Wherever he
was, he left no room for another, because he exacted the
attention, and employed the activity of the whole family.&nbsp;
His errands were so frequent and frivolous, that the footmen in
time avoided and neglected him, and the Earl of Oxford discharged
some of his servants for their resolute refusal of his
messages.&nbsp; The maids, when they had neglected their
business, alleged that they had been employed by Mr. Pope.&nbsp;
One of his constant demands was of coffee in the night, and to
the woman that waited on him in his chamber he was very
burthensome.&nbsp; But he was careful to recompense her want of
sleep, and Lord Oxford&rsquo;s servant declared, that in the
house where her business was to answer his call, she would not
ask for wages.&nbsp; He had another fault, easily incident to
those who, suffering much pain, think themselves entitled to what
pleasures they can snatch.&nbsp; He was too indulgent to his
appetite: he loved meat highly seasoned and of strong taste; and,
at the intervals of the table, amused himself with biscuits and
dry conserves.&nbsp; If he sat down to a variety of dishes, he
would oppress his stomach with repletion; and though he seemed
angry when a dram was offered him, did not forbear to drink
it.&nbsp; His friends, who knew the avenues to his heart,
pampered him with presents of luxury, which he did not suffer to
stand neglected.&nbsp; The death of great men is not always
proportioned to the lustre of their lives.&nbsp; Hannibal, says
Juvenal, did not perish by the javelin or the sword, the
slaughters of Cann&aelig; were revenged by a ring.&nbsp; The
death of Pope was imputed by some of his friends to a silver
saucepan, in which it was his delight to eat potted
lampreys.&nbsp; That he loved too well to eat is certain; but
that his sensuality shortened his life will not be hastily
concluded, when it is remembered that a conformation so irregular
lasted six-and-fifty years, notwithstanding such pertinacious
diligence of study and meditation.&nbsp; In all his intercourse
with mankind he had great delight in artifice, and endeavoured to
attain all his purposes by indirect and unsuspected
methods.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hardly drank tea without a
stratagem.&rdquo;&nbsp; If at the house of friends he wanted any
accommodation, he was not willing to ask for it in plain terms,
but would mention it remotely as something convenient; though
when it was procured, he soon made it appear for whose sake it
had been recommended.&nbsp; Thus he teased Lord Orrery till he
obtained a screen.&nbsp; He practised his arts on such small
occasions, that Lady Bolingbroke used to say, in a French phrase,
that &ldquo;he played the politician about cabbages and
turnips.&rdquo;&nbsp; His unjustifiable impression of the
&ldquo;Patriot King,&rdquo; as it can be attributed to no
particular motive, must have proceeded from his general habit of
secrecy and cunning; he caught an opportunity of a sly trick, and
pleased himself with the thought of outwitting Bolingbroke.&nbsp;
In familiar or convivial conversation, it does not appear that he
excelled.&nbsp; He may be said to have resembled Dryden, as being
not one that was distinguished by vivacity in company.&nbsp; It
is remarkable that, so near his time, so much should be known of
what he has written, and so little of what he has said:
traditional memory retains no sallies of raillery, nor sentences
of observation: nothing either pointed or solid, either wise or
merry.&nbsp; One apophthegm only stands upon record.&nbsp; When
an objection, raised against his inscription for Shakespeare, was
defended by the authority of Patrick, he replied, <i>horresco
referens</i>, that he &ldquo;would allow the publisher of a
dictionary to know the meaning of a single word, but not of two
words put together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was fretful and easily displeased, and allowed himself to
be capriciously resentful.&nbsp; He would sometimes leave Lord
Oxford silently, no one could tell why, and was to be courted
back by more letters and messages than the footmen were willing
to carry.&nbsp; The table was indeed infested by Lady Mary
Wortley, who was the friend of Lady Oxford, and who, knowing his
peevishness, could by no entreaties be restrained from
contradicting him, till their disputes were sharpened to such
asperity, that one or the other quitted the house.&nbsp; He
sometimes condescended to be jocular with servants or inferiors;
but by no merriment, either of others or his own, was he ever
seen excited to laughter.</p>
<p>Of his domestic character, frugality was a part eminently
remarkable.&nbsp; Having determined not to be dependent, he
determined not to be in want, and therefore wisely and
magnanimously rejected all temptations to expense unsuitable to
his fortune.&nbsp; This general care must be universally
approved; but it sometimes appeared in petty artifices of
parsimony, such as the practice of writing his compositions on
the back of letters, as may be seen in the remaining copy of the
&ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; by which perhaps in five years five
shillings were saved; or in a niggardly reception of his friends,
and scantiness of entertainment, as, when he had two guests in
his house, he would set at supper a single pint upon the table;
and having himself taken two small glasses, would retire, and
say, &ldquo;Gentlemen.&nbsp; I leave you to your
wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet he tells his friends that &ldquo;he has a
heart for all, a house for all, and whatever they may think, a
fortune for all.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sometimes, however, made a
splendid dinner, and is said to have wanted no part of the skill
or elegance which such performances require.&nbsp; That this
magnificence should be often displayed, that obstinate prudence
with which he conducted his affairs would not permit; for his
revenue, certain and casual, amounted only to about eight hundred
pounds a year, of which, however, he declares himself able to
assign one hundred to charity.&nbsp; Of this fortune, which, as
it arose from public approbation, was very honourably obtained,
his imagination seems to have been too full: it would be hard to
find a man so well entitled to notice by his wit, that ever
delighted so much in talking of his money.&nbsp; In his Letters
and in his poems, his garden and his grotto, his quincunx and his
vines, or some hints of his opulence, are always to be
found.&nbsp; The great topic of his ridicule is poverty; the
crimes with which he reproaches his antagonists are their debts,
their habitation in the Mint, and their want of a dinner.&nbsp;
He seems to be of an opinion not very uncommon in the world, that
to want money is to want everything.&nbsp; Next to the pleasure
of contemplating his possessions, seems to be that of enumerating
the men of high rank with whom he was acquainted, and whose
notice he loudly proclaims not to have been obtained by any
practices of meanness or servility; a boast which was never
denied to be true, and to which very few poets have ever
aspired.&nbsp; Pope never set genius to sale; he never flattered
those whom he did not love, nor praised those whom he did not
esteem.&nbsp; Savage, however, remarked that he began a little to
relax his dignity when he wrote a distich for &ldquo;his
Highness&rsquo;s dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His admiration of the great seems to have increased in the
advance of life.&nbsp; He passed over peers and statesmen to
inscribe his &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; to Congreve, with a magnanimity
of which the praise had been complete, had his friend&rsquo;s
virtue been equal to his wit.&nbsp; Why he was chosen for so
great an honour, it is not now possible to know; there is no
trace in literary history of any particular intimacy between
them.&nbsp; The name of Congreve appears in the Letters among
those of his other friends, but without any observable
distinction or consequence.&nbsp; To his latter works, however,
he took care to annex names dignified with titles, but was not
very happy in his choice; for, except Lord Bathurst, none of his
noble friends were such as that a good man would wish to have his
intimacy with them known to posterity; he can derive little
honour from the notice of Cobham, Burlington, or Bolingbroke.</p>
<p>Of his social qualities, if an estimate be made from his
Letters, an opinion too favourable cannot easily be formed; they
exhibit a perpetual and unclouded effulgence of general
benevolence, and particular fondness.&nbsp; There is nothing but
liberality, gratitude, constancy, and tenderness.&nbsp; It has
been so long said as to be commonly believed, that the true
characters of men may be found in their letters, and that he who
writes to his friend lays his heart open before him.&nbsp; But
the truth is that such were the simple friendships of the Golden
Age, and are now the friendships only of children.&nbsp; Very few
can boast of hearts which they dare lay open to themselves, and
of which, by whatever accident exposed, they do not shun a
distinct and continued view; and, certainly, who we hide from
ourselves we do not show to our friend.&nbsp; There is, indeed,
no transaction which offers strange temptations to fallacy and
sophistication than epistolary intercourse.&nbsp; In the
eagerness of conversation the first emotions of the mind often
burst out before they are considered; in the tumult of business,
interest and passion have their genuine effect; but a friendly
letter is a calm and deliberate performance in the cool of
leisure, in the stillness of solitude, and surely no man sits
down to depreciate by design his own character.</p>
<p>Friendship has no tendency to secure veracity; for by whom can
a man so much wish to be thought better than he is, as by him
whose kindness he desires to gain or keep?&nbsp; Even in writing
to the world there is less constraint; the author is not
confronted with his reader, and takes his chance of approbation
among the different dispositions of mankind; but a letter is
addressed to a single mind, of which the prejudices and
partialities are known; and must therefore please, if not by
favouring them, by forbearing to oppose them.&nbsp; To charge
those favourable representations, which men give of their own
minds, with the guilt of hypocritical falsehood, would show more
severity than knowledge.&nbsp; The writer commonly believes
himself.&nbsp; Almost every man&rsquo;s thoughts, while they are
general, are right; and most hearts are pure while temptation is
away.&nbsp; It is easy to awaken generous sentiments in privacy;
to despise death when there is no danger; to glow with
benevolence when there is nothing to be given.&nbsp; While such
ideas are formed they are felt; and self-love does not suspect
the gleam of virtue to be the meteor of fancy.</p>
<p>If the Letters of Pope are considered merely as compositions,
they seem to be premeditated and artificial.&nbsp; It is one
thing to write because there is something which the mind wishes
to discharge, and another to solicit the imagination because
ceremony or vanity requires something to be written.&nbsp; Pope
confesses his early Letters to be vitiated with <i>affectation
and ambition</i>: to know whether he disentangled himself from
these perverters of epistolary integrity, his book and his life
must be set in comparison.&nbsp; One of his favourite topics is
contempt of his own poetry.&nbsp; For this, if it had been real,
he would deserve no commendation; and in this he was certainly
not sincere, for his high value of himself was sufficiently
observed; and of what could he be proud but of his poetry?&nbsp;
He writes, he says, when &ldquo;he has just nothing else to
do;&rdquo; yet Swift complains that he was never at leisure for
conversation, because he &ldquo;had always some poetical scheme
in his head.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was punctually required that his
writing-box should be set upon his bed before he rose; and Lord
Oxford&rsquo;s domestic related that, in the dreadful winter of
Forty, she was called from her bed by him four times in one
night, to supply him with paper, lest he should lose a
thought.&nbsp; He pretends insensibility to censure and
criticism, though it was observed by all who knew him that every
pamphlet disturbed his quiet, and that his extreme irritability
laid him open to perpetual vexation; but he wished to despise his
critics, and therefore hoped that he did despise them.&nbsp; As
he happened to live in two reigns when the court paid little
attention to poetry, he nursed in his mind a foolish disesteem of
kings, and proclaims that &ldquo;he never sees
courts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet a little regard shown him by the Prince
of Wales melted his obduracy; and he had not much to say when he
was asked by his Royal Highness, &ldquo;How he could love a
prince while he disliked kings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He very frequently professes contempt of the world, and
represents himself as looking on mankind, sometimes with gay
indifference, as on emmets of a hillock, below his serious
attention; and sometimes with gloomy indignation, as on monsters
more worthy of hatred than pity.&nbsp; These were dispositions
apparently counterfeited.&nbsp; How could he despise those whom
he lived by pleasing, and on whose approbation his esteem of
himself was superstructed?&nbsp; Why should he hate those to
whose favour he owed his honour and his ease?&nbsp; Of things
that terminate in human life, the world is the proper judge: to
despise its sentence, if it were possible, is not just; and if it
were just, is not possible.&nbsp; Pope was far enough from this
unreasonable temper; he was sufficiently <i>a fool to fame</i>,
and his fault was that he pretended to neglect it.&nbsp; His
levity and his sullenness were only in his letters; he passed
through common life, sometimes vexed, and sometimes pleased, with
the natural emotions of common men.&nbsp; His scorn of the great
is repeated too often to be real; no man thinks much of that
which he despises; and as falsehood is always in danger of
inconsistency, he makes it his boast at another time that he
lives among them.&nbsp; It is evident that his own importance
swells often in his mind.&nbsp; He is afraid of writing, lest the
clerks of the post-office should know his secrets; he has many
enemies; he considers himself as surrounded by universal
jealousy: &ldquo;After many deaths, and many dispersions, two or
three of us,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;may still be brought
together, not to plot, but to divert ourselves, and the world
too, if it pleases;&rdquo; and they can live together, and
&ldquo;show what friends wits may be, in spite of all the fools
in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this while it was likely that the
clerks did not know his hand; he certainly had no more enemies
than a public character like his inevitably excites; and with
what degree of friendship the wits might live, very few were so
much fools as ever to inquire.&nbsp; Some part of this pretended
discontent he learned from Swift, and expresses it, I think, most
frequently in his correspondence with him.&nbsp; Swift&rsquo;s
resentment was unreasonable, but it was sincere; Pope&rsquo;s was
the mere mimicry of his friend, a fictitious part which he began
to play before it became him.&nbsp; When he was only twenty-five
years old, he related that &ldquo;a glut of study and retirement
had thrown him on the world,&rdquo; and that there was danger
lest &ldquo;a glut of the world should throw him back upon study
and retirement.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this Swift answered with great
propriety, that Pope had not yet acted or suffered enough in the
world to have become weary of it.&nbsp; And, indeed, it must have
been some very powerful reason that can drive back to solitude
him who has once enjoyed the pleasures of society.</p>
<p>In the Letters both of Swift and Pope there appears such
narrowness of mind as makes them insensible of any excellence
that has not some affinity with their own, and confines their
esteem and approbation to so small a number, that whoever should
form his opinion of their age from their representation, would
suppose them to have lived amidst ignorance and barbarity, unable
to find among their contemporaries either virtue or intelligence,
and persecuted by those that could not understand them.</p>
<p>When Pope murmurs at the world, when he professes contempt of
fame, when he speaks of riches and poverty, of success and
disappointment, with negligent indifference, he certainly does
not express his habitual and settled resentments, but either
wilfully disguises his own character, or, what is more likely,
invests himself with temporary qualities, and sallies out in the
colours of the present moment.&nbsp; His hopes and fears, his
joys and sorrows, acted strongly upon his mind, and if he
differed from others it was not by carelessness; he was irritable
and resentful; his malignity to Philips, whom he had first made
ridiculous and then hated for being angry continued too
long.&nbsp; Of his vain desire to make Bentley contemptible I
never heard any adequate reason.&nbsp; He was sometimes wanton in
his attacks, and before Chandos, Lady Wortley, and Hill, was mean
in his retreat.&nbsp; The virtues which seem to have had most of
his affection were liberality and fidelity of friendship, in
which it does not appear that he was other than he describes
himself.&nbsp; His fortune did not suffer his character to be
splendid and conspicuous, but he assisted Dodsley with a hundred
pounds that he might open a shop, and of the subscription of
forty pounds a year that he raised for Savage twenty were paid by
himself.&nbsp; He was accused of loving money, but his love was
eagerness to gain, not solicitude to keep it.&nbsp; In the duties
of friendship he was zealous and constant; his early maturity of
mind commonly united him with men older than himself, and
therefore, without attaining any considerable length of life, he
saw many companions of his youth sink into the grave; but it does
not appear that he lost a single friend by coldness or by injury;
those who loved him once continued their kindness.&nbsp; His
ungrateful mention of Allen in his will was the effect of his
adherence to one whom he had known much longer, and whom he
naturally loved with greater fondness.&nbsp; His violation of the
trust reposed in him by Bolingbroke could have no motive
inconsistent with the warmest affection; he either thought the
action so near to indifferent that he forgot it, or so laudable
that he expected his friend to approve it.&nbsp; It was reported
with such confidence as almost to enforce belief, that in the
papers entrusted to his executors was found a defamatory Life of
Swift, which he had prepared as an instrument of vengeance, to be
used if any provocation should be ever given.&nbsp; About this I
inquired of the Earl of Marchmont, who assured me that no such
piece was among his remains.</p>
<p>The religion in which he lived and died was that of the Church
of Rome, to which, in his correspondence with Racine, he
professes himself a sincere adherent.&nbsp; That he was not
scrupulously pious in some part of his life is known by many idle
and indecent applications of sentences taken from the Scriptures,
a mode of merriment which a good man dreads for its profaneness,
and a witty man disdains for its easiness and vulgarity.&nbsp;
But to whatever levities he has been betrayed, it does not appear
that his principles were ever corrupted, or that he ever lost his
belief of revelation.&nbsp; The positions which he transmitted
from Bolingbroke he seems not to have understood, and was pleased
with an interpretation that made them orthodox.</p>
<p>A man of such exalted superiority and so little moderation
would naturally have all his delinquencies observed and
aggravated; those who could not deny that he was excellent would
rejoice to find that he was not perfect.&nbsp; Perhaps it may be
imputed to the unwillingness with which the same man is allowed
to possess many advantages, that his learning has been
depreciated.&nbsp; He certainly was in his early life a man of
great literary curiosity, and when he wrote his &ldquo;Essay on
Criticism,&rdquo; had, for his age, a very wide acquaintance with
books.&nbsp; When he entered into the living world it seems to
have happened to him, as to many others, that he was less
attentive to dead masters; he studied in the academy of
Paracelsus, and made the universe his favourite volume.&nbsp; He
gathered his notions fresh from reality, not from the copies of
authors, but the originals of Nature.&nbsp; Yet there is no
reason to believe that literature ever lost his esteem; he always
professed to love reading, and Dobson, who spent some time at his
house translating his &ldquo;Essay on Man,&rdquo; when I asked
him what learning he found him to possess, answered, &ldquo;More
than I expected.&rdquo;&nbsp; His frequent references to history,
his allusions to various kinds of knowledge, and his images
selected from art and nature, with his observations on the
operations of the mind and the modes of life, show an
intelligence perpetually on the wing, excursive, vigorous, and
diligent, eager to pursue knowledge, and attentive to retain
it.&nbsp; From this curiosity arose the desire of travelling, to
which he alludes in his verses to Jervas, and which, though he
never found an opportunity to gratify it, did not leave him till
his life declined.</p>
<p>Of his intellectual character, the constituent and fundamental
principle was good sense, a prompt and intuitive perception of
consonance and propriety.&nbsp; He saw immediately of his own
conceptions what was to be chosen and what to be rejected, and,
in the works of others, what was to be shunned and what was to be
copied.&nbsp; But good sense alone is a sedate and quiescent
quality, which manages its possessions well, but does not
increase them; it collects few materials for its own operations,
and preserves safety, but never gains supremacy.&nbsp; Pope had
likewise genius; a mind active, ambitious, and adventurous,
always investigating, always aspiring; in its widest searches
still longing to go forward, in its highest flights still wishing
to be higher, always imagining some thing greater than it knows,
always endeavouring more than it can do.&nbsp; To assist these
powers he is said to have had great strength and exactness of
memory.&nbsp; That which he had heard or read was not easily
lost, and he had before him not only what his own meditations
suggested, but what he had found in other writers that might be
accommodated to his present purpose.&nbsp; These benefits of
Nature he improved by incessant and unwearied diligence; he had
recourse to every source of intelligence, and lost no opportunity
of information; he consulted the living as well as the dead; he
read his compositions to his friends, and was never content with
mediocrity when excellence could be attained.&nbsp; He considered
poetry as the business of his life, and however he might seem to
lament his occupation he followed it with constancy; to make
verses was his first labour, and to mend them was his last.&nbsp;
From his attention to poetry he was never diverted.&nbsp; If
conversation offered anything that could be improved, he
committed it to paper; if a thought, or perhaps an expression,
more happy than was common, rose to his mind, he was careful to
write it; an independent distich was preserved for an opportunity
of insertion, and some little fragments have been found
containing lines, or parts of lines, to be wrought upon at some
other time.&nbsp; He was one of those few whose labour is their
pleasure; he was never elevated to negligence nor wearied to
impatience; he never passed a fault unamended by indifference,
nor quitted it by despair.&nbsp; He laboured his works first to
gain reputation, and afterwards to keep it.</p>
<p>Of composition there are different methods.&nbsp; Some employ
at once memory and invention, and, with little intermediate use
of the pen, form and polish large masses by continued meditation,
and write their productions only when, in their own opinion, they
have completed them.&nbsp; It is related of Virgil that his
custom was to pour out a great number of verses in the morning,
and pass the day in retrenching exuberances and correcting
inaccuracies.&nbsp; The method of Pope, as may be collected from
his translation, was to write his first thoughts in his first
words, and gradually to amplify, decorate, rectify, and refine
them.&nbsp; With such faculties and such dispositions he excelled
every other writer in poetical prudence; he wrote in such a
manner as might expose him to few hazards.&nbsp; He used almost
always the same fabric of verse, and, indeed, by those few essays
which he made of any other, he did not enlarge his
reputation.&nbsp; Of this uniformity the certain consequence was
readiness and dexterity.&nbsp; By perpetual practice language
had, in his mind, a systematical arrangement; having always the
same use for words, he had words so selected and combined as to
be ready at his call.&nbsp; This increase of facility he
confessed himself to have perceived in the progress of his
translation.&nbsp; But what was yet of more importance, his
effusions were always voluntary, and his subjects chosen by
himself.&nbsp; His independence secured him from drudging at a
task, and labouring upon a barren topic; he never exchanged
praise for money, nor opened a shop of condolence or
congratulation.&nbsp; His poems, therefore, were scarcely ever
temporary.&nbsp; He suffered coronations and royal marriages to
pass without a song, and derived no opportunities from recent
events, nor any popularity from the accidental disposition of his
readers.&nbsp; He was never reduced to the necessity of
soliciting the sun to shine upon a birthday, of calling the
graces and virtues to a wedding, or of saying what multitudes
have said before him.&nbsp; When he could produce nothing new he
was at liberty to be silent.</p>
<p>His publications were for the same reason never hasty.&nbsp;
He is said to have sent nothing to the press till it had lain two
years under his inspection: it is at least certain that he
ventured nothing without nice examination.&nbsp; He suffered the
tumult of imagination to subside, and the novelties of invention
to grow familiar.&nbsp; He knew that the mind is always enamoured
of its own productions, and did not trust his first
fondness.&nbsp; He consulted his friends, and listened with great
willingness to criticism; and, what was of more importance, he
consulted himself, and let nothing pass against his own
judgment.&nbsp; He professed to have learned his poetry from
Dryden, whom, whenever an opportunity was presented, he praised
through his whole life with unvaried liberality; and perhaps his
character may receive some illustration if he be compared with
his master.</p>
<p>Integrity of understanding and nicety of discernment were not
allotted in a less proportion to Dryden than to Pope.&nbsp; The
rectitude of Dryden&rsquo;s mind was sufficiently shown by the
dismission of his poetical prejudices, and the rejection of
unnatural thoughts and rugged numbers.&nbsp; But Dryden never
desired to apply all the judgment that he had.&nbsp; He wrote,
and professed to write, merely for the people; and when he
pleased others, he contented himself.&nbsp; He spent no time in
struggles to rouse latent powers; he never attempted to make that
better which was already good, nor often to mend what he must
have known to be faulty.&nbsp; He wrote, as he tells us, with
very little consideration; when occasion or necessity called upon
him, he poured out what the present moment happened to supply,
and, when once it had passed the press, ejected it from his mind;
for, when he had no pecuniary interest, he had no further
solicitude.</p>
<p>Pope was not content to satisfy; he desired to excel, and
therefore always endeavoured to do his best; he did not court the
candour, but dared the judgment of his reader, and, expecting no
indulgence from others, he showed none to himself.&nbsp; He
examined lines and words with minute and punctilious observation,
and retouched every part with indefatigable diligence, till he
had left nothing to be forgiven.&nbsp; For this reason he kept
his pieces very long in his hands, while he considered and
reconsidered them.&nbsp; The only poems which can be supposed to
have been written with such regard to the times as might hasten
their publication, were the two satires of
&ldquo;Thirty-eight;&rdquo; of which Dodsley told me that they
were brought to him by the author, that they might be fairly
copied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Almost every line,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;was then written twice over; I gave him a clean
transcript, which he sent some time afterwards to me for the
press, with almost every line written twice over a second
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; His declaration, that his care for his works
ceased at their publication, was not strictly true.&nbsp; His
parental attention never abandoned them; what he found amiss in
the first edition, he silently corrected in those that
followed.&nbsp; He appears to have revised the
&ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; and freed it from some of its imperfections;
and the &ldquo;Essay on Criticism&rdquo; received many
improvements after its first appearance.&nbsp; It will seldom be
found that he altered without adding clearness, elegance, or
vigour.&nbsp; Pope had perhaps the judgment of Dryden; but Dryden
certainly wanted the diligence of Pope.</p>
<p>In acquired knowledge, the superiority must be allowed to
Dryden, whose education was more scholastic, and who before he
became an author had been allowed more time for study, with
better means of information.&nbsp; His mind has a larger range,
and he collects his images and illustrations from a more
extensive circumference of science.&nbsp; Dryden knew more of man
in his general nature, and Pope in his local manners.&nbsp; The
notions of Dryden were formed by comprehensive speculation, and
those of Pope by minute attention.&nbsp; There is more dignity in
the knowledge of Dryden, and more certainty in that of
Pope.&nbsp; Poetry was not the sole praise of either; for both
excelled likewise in prose; but Pope did not borrow his prose
from his predecessor.&nbsp; The style of Dryden is capricious and
varied; that of Pope is cautious and uniform.&nbsp; Dryden
observes the motions of his own mind; Pope constrains his mind to
his own rules of composition.&nbsp; Dryden is sometimes vehement
and rapid; Pope is always smooth, uniform, and gentle.&nbsp;
Dryden&rsquo;s page is a natural field, rising into inequalities,
and diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation;
Pope&rsquo;s is a velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe, and levelled
by the roller.</p>
<p>Of genius, that power which constitutes a poet; that quality
without which judgment is cold, and knowledge is inert; that
energy which collects, combines, amplifies, and animates; the
superiority must, with some hesitation, be allowed to
Dryden.&nbsp; It is not to be inferred that of this poetical
vigour Pope had only a little, because Dryden had more; for every
other writer since Milton must give place to Pope; and even of
Dryden it must be said that, if he has brighter paragraphs, he
has not better poems.&nbsp; Dryden&rsquo;s performances were
always hasty, either excited by some external occasion, or
extorted by domestic necessity; he composed without
consideration, and published without correction.&nbsp; What his
mind could supply at call, or gather in one excursion, was all
that he sought, and all that he gave.&nbsp; The dilatory caution
of Pope enabled him to condense his sentiments, to multiply his
images, and to accumulate all that study might produce or chance
might supply.&nbsp; If the flights of Dryden therefore are
higher, Pope continues longer on the wing.&nbsp; If of
Dryden&rsquo;s fire the blaze is brighter, of Pope&rsquo;s the
heat is more regular and constant.&nbsp; Dryden often surpasses
expectation, and Pope never falls below it.&nbsp; Dryden is read
with frequent astonishment, and Pope with perpetual
delight.&nbsp; This parallel will, I hope, when it is well
considered, be found just; and if the reader should suspect me,
as I suspect myself, of some partial fondness for the memory of
Dryden, let him not too hastily condemn me; for meditation and
inquiry may, perhaps, show him the reasonableness of my
determination.</p>
<p>The Works of Pope are now to be distinctly examined, not so
much with attention to slight faults or petty beauties, as to the
general character and effect of each performance.</p>
<p>It seems natural for a young poet to initiate himself by
pastorals, which, not professing to imitate real life, require no
experience; and, exhibiting only the simple operation of
unmingled passions, admit no subtle reasoning or deep
inquiry.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s pastorals are not, however, composed
but with close thought; they have reference to the times of the
day, the seasons of the year, and the periods of human
life.&nbsp; The last, that which turns the attention upon age and
death, was the author&rsquo;s favourite.&nbsp; To tell of
disappointment and misery, to thicken the darkness of futurity
and perplex the labyrinth of uncertainty, has been always a
delicious employment of the poets.&nbsp; His preference was
probably just.&nbsp; I wish, however, that his fondness had not
overlooked a line in which the Zephyrs are made to lament in
silence.&nbsp; To charge these pastorals with wane of invention,
is to require what was never intended.&nbsp; The imitations are
so ambitiously frequent, that the writer evidently means rather
to show his literature than his wit.&nbsp; It is surely
sufficient for an author of sixteen, not only to be able to copy
the poems of antiquity with judicious selection, but to have
obtained sufficient power of language, and skill in metre, to
exhibit a series of versification which had in English poetry no
precedent, nor has since had an imitation.</p>
<p>The design of &ldquo;Windsor Forest&rdquo; is evidently
derived from &ldquo;Cooper&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; with some
attention to Waller&rsquo;s poem on &ldquo;The Park;&rdquo; but
Pope cannot be denied to excel his masters in variety and
elegance, and the art of interchanging description, narrative,
and morality.&nbsp; The objection made by Dennis is the want of
plan, of a regular subordination of parts terminating in the
principal and original design.&nbsp; There is this want in most
descriptive poems, because as the scenes, which they must exhibit
successively, are all subsisting at the same time, the order in
which they are shown must by necessity be arbitrary, and more is
not to be expected from the last part than from the first.&nbsp;
The attention, therefore, which cannot be detained by suspense,
must be excited by diversity, such as this poem offers to its
reader.&nbsp; But the desire of diversity may be too much
indulged; the parts of &ldquo;Windsor Forest&rdquo; which deserve
least praise are those which were added to enliven the stillness
of the scene&mdash;the appearance of Father Thames, and the
transformation of Lodona.&nbsp; Addison had in his
&ldquo;Campaign&rdquo; derided the rivers that &ldquo;rise from
their oozy beds&rdquo; to tell stories of heroes; and it is
therefore strange that Pope should adopt a fiction not only
unnatural, but lately censured.&nbsp; The story of Lodona is told
with sweetness; but a new metamorphosis is a ready and puerile
expedient; nothing is easier than to tell how a flower was once a
blooming virgin, or a rock an obdurate tyrant.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Temple of Fame&rdquo; has, as Steele warmly
declared, a &ldquo;thousand beauties.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every part is
splendid; there is great luxuriance of ornaments; the original
vision of Chaucer was never denied to be much improved; the
allegory is very skilfully continued, the imagery is properly
selected, and learnedly displayed; yet, with all this
comprehension of excellence, as its scene is laid in remote ages,
and its sentiments, if the concluding paragraph be excepted, have
little relation to general manners or common life, it never
obtained much notice, but is turned silently over, and seldom
quoted or mentioned with either praise or blame.</p>
<p>That the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; excels the &ldquo;Pollio&rdquo;
is no great praise, if it be considered from what original the
improvements are derived.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Verses on the Unfortunate Lady&rdquo; have drawn
much attention by the illaudable singularity of treating suicide
with respect; and they must be allowed to be written in some
parts with vigorous animation, and in others with gentle
tenderness; nor has Pope produced any poem in which the sense
predominates more over the diction.&nbsp; But the tale is not
skilfully told; it is not easy to discover the character of
either the lady or her guardian.&nbsp; History relates that she
was about to disparage herself by a marriage with an inferior;
Pope praises her for the dignity of ambition, and yet condemns
the uncle to detestation for his pride; the ambitious love of a
niece may be opposed by the interest, malice, or envy of an
uncle, but never by his pride.&nbsp; On such an occasion a poet
may be allowed to be obscure, but inconsistency never can be
right.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ode for St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; was
undertaken at the desire of Steele: in this the author is
generally confessed to have miscarried, yet he has miscarried
only as compared with Dryden; for he has far outgone other
competitors.&nbsp; Dryden&rsquo;s plan is better chosen; history
will always take stronger hold of the attention than fable: the
passions excited by Dryden are the pleasures and pains of real
life, the scene of Pope is laid in imaginary existence; Pope is
read with calm acquiescence, Dryden with turbulent delight; Pope
hangs upon the ear, and Dryden finds the passes of the
mind.&nbsp; Both the odes want the essential constituent of
metrical compositions, the stated recurrence of settled
numbers.&nbsp; It may be alleged that Pindar is said by Horace to
have written <i>numeris lege solutis</i>; but as no such lax
performances have been transmitted to us, the meaning of that
expression cannot be fixed; and perhaps the like return might
properly be made to a modern Pindarist as Mr. Cobb received from
Bentley, who, when he found his criticisms upon a Greek exercise,
which Cobb had presented, refuted one after another by
Pindar&rsquo;s authority, cried out at last, &ldquo;Pindar was a
bold fellow, but thou art an impudent one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Pope&rsquo;s ode be particularly inspected, it will be
found that the first stanza consists of sounds well chosen
indeed, but only sounds.&nbsp; The second consists of
hyperbolical commonplaces, easily to be found, and perhaps
without much difficulty to be as well expressed.&nbsp; In the
third, however, there are numbers, images, harmony, and rigour,
not unworthy the antagonist of Dryden.&nbsp; Had all been like
this&mdash;but every part cannot be the best.&nbsp; The next
stanzas place and detain us in the dark and dismal regions of
mythology, where neither hope nor fear, neither joy nor sorrow
can be found: the poet, however, faithfully attends us; we have
all that can be performed by elegance of diction or sweetness of
versification; but what can form avail without better
matter?&nbsp; The last stanza recurs again to commonplaces.&nbsp;
The conclusion is too evidently modelled by that of Dryden; and
it may be remarked that both end with the same fault; the
comparison of each is literal on one side and metaphorical on the
other.&nbsp; Poets do not always express their own thoughts:
Pope, with all this labour in the praise of music, was ignorant
of its principles and insensible of its effects.</p>
<p>One of his greatest, though of his earliest works, is the
&ldquo;Essay on Criticism,&rdquo; which, if he had written
nothing else, would have placed him among the first critics and
the first poets, as it exhibits every mode of excellence that can
embellish or dignify didactic composition, selection of matter,
novelty of arrangement, justness of precept, splendour of
illustration, and propriety of digression.&nbsp; I know not
whether it be pleasing to consider that he produced this piece at
twenty, and never afterwards excelled it: he that delights
himself with observing that such powers may be soon attained,
cannot but grieve to think that life was ever after at a
stand.</p>
<p>To mention the particular beauties of the essay would be
unprofitably tedious: but I cannot forbear to observe that the
comparison of a student&rsquo;s progress in the sciences with the
journey of a traveller in the Alps is perhaps the best that
English poetry can show.&nbsp; A simile, to be perfect, must both
illustrate and ennoble the subject; must show it to the
understanding in a clearer view, and display it to the fancy with
greater dignity; but either of these qualities may be sufficient
to recommend it.&nbsp; In didactic poetry, of which the great
purpose is instruction, a simile may be praised which
illustrates, though it does not ennoble; in heroics, that may be
admitted which ennobles, though it does not illustrate.&nbsp;
That it may be complete, it is required to exhibit, independently
of its references, a pleasing image; for a simile is said to be a
short episode.&nbsp; To this antiquity was so attentive, that
circumstances were sometimes added, which, having no parallels,
served only to fill the imagination, and produced what Perrault
ludicrously called &ldquo;comparisons with a long
tail.&rdquo;&nbsp; In their similes the greatest writers have
sometimes failed; the ship-race, compared with the chariot-race,
is neither illustrated nor aggrandised; land and water make all
the difference: when Apollo, running after Daphne, is likened to
a greyhound chasing a hare, there is nothing gained; the ideas of
pursuit and flight are too plain to be made plainer; and a god
and the daughter of a god are not represented much to their
advantage by a hare and dog.&nbsp; The simile of the Alps has no
useless parts, yet affords a striking picture by itself; it makes
the foregoing position better understood, and enables it to take
faster hold on the attention; it assists the apprehension and
elevates the fancy.&nbsp; Let me likewise dwell a little on the
celebrated paragraph in which it is directed that &ldquo;the
sound should seem an echo to the sense;&rdquo; a precept which
Pope is allowed to have observed beyond any other English
poet.</p>
<p>This notion of representative metre, and the desire of
discovering frequent adaptations of the sound to the sense, have
produced, in my opinion, many wild conceits and imaginary
beauties.&nbsp; All that can furnish this representation are the
sounds of the words considered singly and the time in which they
are pronounced.&nbsp; Every language has some words framed to
exhibit the noises which they express, as <i>thump</i>,
<i>rattle</i>, <i>growl</i>, <i>hiss</i>.&nbsp; These, however,
are but few, and the poet cannot make them more, nor can they be
of any use but when sound is to be mentioned.&nbsp; The time of
pronunciation was in the dactylic measures of the learned
languages capable of considerable variety; but that variety could
be accommodated only to motion or duration, and different degrees
of motion were perhaps expressed by verses rapid or slow, without
much attention of the writer, when the image had full possession
of his fancy: but our language having little flexibility, our
verses can differ very little in their cadence.&nbsp; The fancied
resemblances, I fear, arise sometimes merely from the ambiguity
of words; there is supposed to be some relation between a
<i>soft</i> line and <i>soft</i> couch, or between <i>heard</i>
syllables and <i>hard</i> fortune.&nbsp; Motion, however, may be
in some sort exemplified; and yet it may be suspected that in
such resemblances the mind often governs the ear, and the sounds
are estimated by their meaning.&nbsp; One of their most
successful attempts has been to describe the labour of
Sisyphus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;With many a weary step, and many a
groan,<br />
Up a high hill he heaves a huge round stone;<br />
The huge round stone, resulting with a bound,<br />
Thunders impetuous down, and smokes along the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who does not perceive the stone to move slowly upward, and
roll violently back?&nbsp; But set the same numbers to another
sense:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;While many a merry tale, and many a
song,<br />
Cheered the rough road, we wished the rough road long.<br />
The rough road, then, returning in a round,<br />
Mocked our impatient steps, for all was fairy ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have now surely lost much of the delay and much of the
rapidity.&nbsp; But, to show how little the greatest master of
numbers can fix the principles of representative harmony, it will
be sufficient to remark that the poet who tells us
that&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;When Ajax strives some rock&rsquo;s vast
weight to throw,<br />
The line too labours, and the words move slow:<br />
Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain,<br />
Flies o&rsquo;er th&rsquo; unbending corn, and skims along the
main;&rdquo;</p>
<p>when he had enjoyed for about thirty years the praise of
Camilla&rsquo;s lightness of foot, he tried another experiment
upon <i>sound</i> and <i>time</i>, and produced this memorable
triplet:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Waller was smooth; but Dryden taught to
join<br />
The varying verse, the full resounding line,<br />
The long majestic march, and energy divine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here are the swiftness of the rapid race, and the march of
slow-paced majesty, exhibited by the same poet in the same
sequence of syllables, except that the exact prosodist will find
the line of <i>swiftness</i> by one time longer than that of
<i>tardiness</i>.&nbsp; Beauties of this kind are commonly
fancied, and, when real, are technical and nugatory, not to be
rejected and not to be solicited.</p>
<p>To the praises which have been accumulated on the &ldquo;Rape
of the Look&rdquo; by readers of every class, from the critic to
the waiting-maid, it is difficult to make any addition.&nbsp; Of
that which is universally allowed to be the most attractive of
all ludicrous compositions, let it rather be now inquired from
what sources the power of pleasing is derived.</p>
<p>Dr. Warburton, who excelled in critical perspicacity, has
remarked that the preternatural agents are very happily adapted
to the purposes of the poem.&nbsp; The heathen deities can no
longer gain attention; we should have turned away from a contest
between Venus and Diana.&nbsp; The employment of allegorical
persons always excites conviction of its own absurdity; they may
produce effects, but cannot conduct actions; when the phantom is
put in motion it dissolves; thus <i>Discord</i> may raise a
mutiny, but <i>Discord</i> cannot conduct a march nor besiege a
town.&nbsp; Pope brought in view a new race of beings, with
powers and passions proportionate to their operation.&nbsp; The
Sylphs and Gnomes act at the toilet and the tea-table what more
terrific and more powerful phantoms perform on the stormy ocean
or the field of battle: they give their proper help and do their
proper mischief.&nbsp; Pope is said, by an objector, not to have
been the inventor of this petty notion, a charge which might with
more justice have been brought against the author of the
&ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; who doubtless adopted the religious system
of his country; for what is there but the names of his agents
which Pope has not invented?&nbsp; Has he not assigned them
characters and operations never heard of before?&nbsp; Has he
not, at least, given them their first poetical existence?&nbsp;
If this is not sufficient to denominate his work original,
nothing original ever can be written.</p>
<p>In this work are exhibited in a very high degree the two most
engaging powers of an author.&nbsp; New things are made familiar,
and familiar things are made new.&nbsp; A race of a&euml;rial
people never heard of before is presented to us in a manner so
clear and easy that the reader seeks for no further information,
but immediately mingles with his new acquaintance, adopts their
interests, and attends their pursuits, loves a Sylph, and detests
a Gnome.&nbsp; That familiar things are made new every paragraph
will prove.&nbsp; The subject of the poem is an event below the
common incidents of common life; nothing real is introduced that
is not seen so often as to be no longer regarded; yet the whole
detail of a female day is here brought before us, invested with
so much art of decoration that, though nothing is disguised,
everything is striking, and we feel all the appetite of curiosity
for that from which we have a thousand times turned fastidiously
away.</p>
<p>The purpose of the poet is, as he tells us, to laugh at
&ldquo;the little unguarded follies of the female
sex.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is therefore without justice that Dennis
charges the &ldquo;Rape of the Lock&rdquo; with the want of a
moral, and for that reason sets it below the
&ldquo;Lutrin,&rdquo; which exposes the pride and discord of the
clergy.&nbsp; Perhaps neither Pope nor Boileau has made the world
much better than he found it; but if they had both succeeded, it
were easy to tell who would have deserved most from public
gratitude.&nbsp; The freaks, and humours, and spleen, and vanity
of women as they embroil families in discord, and fill houses
with disquiet, do more to obstruct the happiness of life in a
year than the ambition of the clergy in many centuries.&nbsp; It
has been well observed that the misery of man proceeds not from
any single crush of overwhelming evil, but from small vexatious
continually repeated.&nbsp; It is remarked by Dennis, likewise,
that the machinery is superfluous; that, by all the bustle of
preternatural operation, the main event is neither hastened nor
retarded.&nbsp; To this charge an efficacious answer is not
easily made.&nbsp; The Sylphs cannot be said to help or oppose;
and it must be allowed to imply some want of art that their power
has not been sufficiently intermingled with the action.&nbsp;
Other parts may likewise be charged with want of
connection&mdash;the game at <i>ombre</i> might be spared; but if
the lady had lost her hair while she was intent upon her cards it
might have been inferred that those who are too fond of play will
be in danger of neglecting more important interests.&nbsp; Those,
perhaps, are faults, but what are such faults to so much
excellence!</p>
<p>The Epistle of &ldquo;Eloise to Abelard&rdquo; is one of the
most happy productions of human wit; the subject is so
judiciously chosen that it would be difficult in turning over the
annals of the world to find another which so many circumstances
concur to recommend.&nbsp; We regularly interest ourselves most
in the fortune of those who most deserve our notice.&nbsp;
Abelard and Eloise were conspicuous in their days for eminence of
merit.&nbsp; The heart naturally loves truth.&nbsp; The
adventures and misfortunes of this illustrious pair are known
from undisputed history.&nbsp; Their fate does not leave the mind
in hopeless dejection, for they both found quiet and consolation
in retirement and piety.&nbsp; So new and so affecting is their
story that it supersedes invention, and imagination ranges at
full liberty without straggling into scenes of fable.&nbsp; The
story thus skilfully adopted has been diligently improved.&nbsp;
Pope has left nothing behind him which seems more the effect of
studious perseverance and laborious revisal.&nbsp; Here is
particularly observable the <i>curiosa felicitas</i>, a fruitful
soil and careful cultivation.&nbsp; Here is no crudeness of sense
nor asperity of language.&nbsp; The sources from which sentiments
which have so much vigour and efficacy have been drawn are shown
to be the mystic writers by the learned author of the
&ldquo;Essays on the Life and Writings of Pope,&rdquo; a book
which teaches how the brow of Criticism may be smoothed, and how
she may be enabled, with all her severity, to attract and to
delight.</p>
<p>The train of my disquisition has now conducted me to that
poetical wonder, the translation of the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; a
performance which no age or nation can pretend to equal.&nbsp; To
the Greeks translation was almost unknown; it was totally unknown
to the inhabitants of Greece.&nbsp; They had no recourse to the
barbarians for poetical beauties, but sought for everything in
Homer, where, indeed, there is but little which they might not
find.&nbsp; The Italians have been very diligent translators, but
I can hear of no version, unless, perhaps, Anguillara&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ovid&rdquo; may be excepted, which is read with
eagerness.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; of Salvini every reader
may discover to be punctiliously exact; but it seems to be the
work of a linguist skilfully pedantic; and his countrymen, the
proper judges of its power to please, reject it with
disgust.&nbsp; Their predecessors, the Romans, have left some
specimens of translation behind them, and that employment must
have had some credit in which Tully and Germanicus engaged; but
unless we suppose, what is perhaps true, that the plays of
Terence were versions of Menander, nothing translated seems ever
to have risen to high reputation.&nbsp; The French in the
meridian hour of their learning were very laudably industrious to
enrich their own language with the wisdom of the ancients; but
found themselves reduced by whatever necessity to turn the Greek
and Roman poetry into prose.&nbsp; Whoever could read an author
could translate him.&nbsp; From such rivals little can be
feared.</p>
<p>The chief help of Pope in this audacious undertaking was drawn
from the versions of Dryden.&nbsp; Virgil had borrowed much of
his imagery from Homer; and part of the debt was now paid by his
translator.&nbsp; Pope searched the pages of Dryden for happy
combinations of heroic diction, but it will not be denied that he
added much to what he found.&nbsp; He cultivated our language
with so much diligence and art, that he has left in his
&ldquo;Homer&rdquo; a treasure of poetical elegances to
posterity.&nbsp; His version may be said to have tuned the
English tongue; for since its appearance no writer, however
deficient in other powers, has wanted melody.&nbsp; Such a series
of lines, so elaborately corrected, and so sweetly modulated,
took possession of the public ear; the vulgar was enamoured of
the poem, and the learned wondered at the translation.&nbsp; But
in the most general applause discordant voices will always be
heard.&nbsp; It has been objected by some who wish to be numbered
among the sons of learning that Pope&rsquo;s version of Homer is
not Homerical; that it exhibits no resemblance of the original
and characteristic manner of the Father of Poetry, as it wants
his artless grandeur, his unaffected majesty.&nbsp; This cannot
be totally denied; but it must be remembered that <i>necessitas
quod cogit defendit</i>; that may be lawfully done which cannot
be forborne.&nbsp; Time and place will always enforce
regard.&nbsp; In estimating this translation, consideration must
be had of the nature of our language, the form of our metre, and,
above all, of the change which two thousand years have made in
the modes of life and the habits of thought.&nbsp; Virgil wrote
in a language of the same general fabric with that of Homer, in
verses of the same measure, and in an age nearer to Homer&rsquo;s
time by eighteen hundred years; yet he found even then the state
of the world so much altered, and the demand for elegance so much
increased, that mere nature would be endured no longer; and,
perhaps, in the multitude of borrowed passages, very few can be
shown which he has not embellished.</p>
<p>There is a time when nations, emerging from barbarity, and
falling into regular subordination, gain leisure to grow wise,
and feel the shame of ignorance and the craving pain of
unsatisfied curiosity.&nbsp; To this hunger of the mind plain
sense is grateful; that which fills the void removes uneasiness,
and to be free from pain for a while is pleasure; but repletion
generates fastidiousness; a saturated intellect soon becomes
luxurious, and knowledge finds no willing reception till it is
recommended by artificial diction.&nbsp; Thus it will be found,
in the progress of learning, that in all nations the first
writers are simple, and that every age improves in
elegance.&nbsp; One refinement always makes way for another; and
what was expedient to Virgil was necessary to Pope.&nbsp; I
suppose many readers of the English &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; when
they have been touched with some unexpected beauty of the lighter
kind, have tried to enjoy it in the original, where, alas! it was
not to be found.&nbsp; Homer doubtless owes to his translator
many Ovidian graces not exactly suitable to his character; but to
have added can be no great crime, if nothing be taken away.&nbsp;
Elegance is surely to be desired, if it be not gained at the
expense of dignity.&nbsp; A hero would wish to be loved, as well
as to be reverenced.&nbsp; To a thousand cavils one answer is
sufficient; the purpose of a writer is to be read, and the
criticism which would destroy the power of pleasing must be blown
aside.&nbsp; Pope wrote for his own age and his own nation: he
knew that it was necessary to colour the images and point the
sentiments of his author; he therefore made him graceful, but
lost him some of his sublimity.&nbsp; The copious notes with
which the version is accompanied, and by which it is recommended
to many readers, though they were undoubtedly written to swell
the volumes, ought not to pass without praise: commentaries which
attract the reader by the pleasure of perusal have not often
appeared; the notes of others are read to clear difficulties;
those of Pope to vary entertainment.&nbsp; It has, however, been
objected, with sufficient reason, that there is in the commentary
too much of unseasonable levity and affected gaiety; that too
many appeals are made to the ladies, and the ease which is so
carefully preserved is sometimes the ease of a trifler.&nbsp;
Every art has its terms, and every kind of instruction its proper
style; the gravity of common critics may be tedious, but is less
despicable than childish merriment.</p>
<p>Of the &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; nothing remains to be observed;
the same general praise may be given to both translations, and a
particular examination of either would require a large
volume.&nbsp; The notes were written by Broome, who endeavoured,
not unsuccessfully, to imitate his master.</p>
<p>Of the &ldquo;Dunciad&rdquo; the hint is confessedly taken
from Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mac Flecknoe;&rdquo; but the plan is
so enlarged and diversified as justly to claim the praise of an
original, and affords the best specimen that has yet appeared of
personal satire ludicrously pompous.&nbsp; That the design was
moral, whatever the author might tell either his readers or
himself, I am not convinced.&nbsp; The first motive was the
desire of revenging the contempt with which Theobald had treated
his Shakspeare, and regaining the honour which he had lost, by
crushing his opponent.&nbsp; Theobald was not of bulk enough to
fill a poem, and therefore it was necessary to find other enemies
with other names, at whose expense he might divert the
public.</p>
<p>In this design there was petulance and malignity enough; but I
cannot think it very criminal.&nbsp; An author places himself
uncalled before the tribunal of criticism, and solicits fame at
the hazard of disgrace.&nbsp; Dulness or deformity are not
culpable in themselves, but may be very justly reproached when
they pretend to the honour of wit or the influence of
beauty.&nbsp; If bad writers were to pass without reprehension,
what should restrain them? <i>impune diem consumpserit ingens
Telephus</i>; and upon bad writers only will censure have much
effect.&nbsp; The satire which brought Theobald and Moore into
contempt dropped impotent from Bentley, like the javelin of
Priam.&nbsp; All truth is valuable, and satirical criticism may
be considered as useful when it rectifies error and improves
judgment; he that refines the public taste is a public
benefactor.&nbsp; The beauties of this poem are well known; its
chief fault is the grossness of its images.&nbsp; Pope and Swift
had an unnatural delight in ideas physically impure, such as
every other tongue utters with unwillingness, and of which every
ear shrinks from the mention.&nbsp; But even this fault,
offensive as it is, may be forgiven for the excellence of other
passages; such as the formation and dissolution of Moore, the
account of the Traveller, the misfortune of the Florist, and the
crowded thoughts and stately numbers which dignify the concluding
paragraph.&nbsp; The alterations which have been made in the
&ldquo;Dunciad,&rdquo; not always for the better, require that it
should be published, as in the present collection, with all its
variations.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Essay on Man&rdquo; was a work of great labour and
long consideration, but certainly not the happiest of
Pope&rsquo;s performances.&nbsp; The subject is perhaps not very
proper for poetry; and the poet was not sufficiently master of
his subject; metaphysical morality was to him a new study; he was
proud of his acquisitions, and, supposing himself master of great
secrets, was in haste to teach what he had not learned.&nbsp;
Thus he tells us, in the first Epistle, that from the nature of
the Supreme Being may be deduced an order of beings such as
mankind, because infinite excellence can do only what is
best.&nbsp; He finds out that these beings must be
&ldquo;somewhere;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;all the question is,
whether man be in a wrong place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely if,
according to the poet&rsquo;s Leibnitzian reasoning, we may infer
that man ought to be, only because he is, we may allow that his
place is the right place, because he has it.&nbsp; Supreme Wisdom
is not less infallible in disposing than in creating.&nbsp; But
what is meant by <i>somewhere</i>, and <i>place</i>, and <i>wrong
piece</i>, it had been in vain to ask Pope, who probably had
never asked himself.</p>
<p>Having exalted himself into the chair of wisdom, he tells us
much that every man knows, and much that he does not know
himself; that we see but little, and that the order of the
universe is beyond our comprehension; an opinion not very
uncommon; and that there is a chain of subordinate beings
&ldquo;from infinite to nothing,&rdquo; of which himself and his
readers are equally ignorant.&nbsp; But he gives us one comfort,
which without his help he supposes unattainable, in the position
&ldquo;that though we are fools, yet God is wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This essay affords an egregious instance of the predominance
of genius, the dazzling splendour of imagery, and the seductive
powers of eloquence.&nbsp; Never was penury of knowledge and
vulgarity of sentiment so happily disguised.&nbsp; The reader
feels his mind full, though he learns nothing; and, when he meets
it in its new array, no longer knows the talk of his mother and
his nurse.&nbsp; When these wonder-working sounds sink into
sense, and the doctrine of the essay, disrobed of its ornaments,
is left to the powers of its naked excellence, what shall we
discover?&nbsp; That we are, in comparison with our Creator, very
weak and ignorant; that we do not uphold the chain of existence;
and that we could not make one another with more skill than we
are made.&nbsp; We may learn yet more that the arts of human life
were copied from the instinctive operations of other animals;
that if the world be made for man, it may be said that man was
made for geese.&nbsp; To these profound principles of natural
knowledge are added some moral instructions equally new; that
self-interest, well understood, will produce social concord; that
men are mutual gainers by mutual benefits; that evil is sometimes
balanced by good; that human advantages are unstable and
fallacious, of uncertain duration and doubtful effect; that our
true honour is not to have a great part, but to act it well; that
virtue only is our own; and that happiness is always in our
power.&nbsp; Surely a man of no very comprehensive search may
venture to say that he has heard all this before; but it was
never till now recommended by such a blaze of embellishments, or
such sweetness of melody.&nbsp; The vigorous contraction of some
thoughts, the luxuriant amplification of others, the incidental
illustrations, and sometimes the dignity, sometimes the softness
of the verses, enchain philosophy, suspend criticism, and oppress
judgment by overpowering pleasure.&nbsp; This is true of many
paragraphs; yet, if I had undertaken to exemplify Pope&rsquo;s
felicity of composition before a rigid critic, I should not
select the &ldquo;Essay on Man;&rdquo; for it contains more lines
unsuccessfully laboured, more harshness of diction, and more
thoughts imperfectly expressed, more levity without elegance, and
more heaviness without strength, than will easily be found in all
his other works.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Characters of Men and Women&rdquo; are the product
of diligent speculation upon human life; much labour has been
bestowed upon them, and Pope very seldom laboured in vain.&nbsp;
That his excellence may be properly estimated, I recommend a
comparison of his &ldquo;Characters of Women&rdquo; with
Boileau&rsquo;s Satire; it will then be seen with how much more
perspicacity female nature is investigated, and female excellence
selected; and he surely is no mean writer to whom Boileau should
be found inferior.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Characters of Men,&rdquo;
however, are written with more, if not with deeper, thought, and
exhibit many passages exquisitely beautiful.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Gem
and the Flower&rdquo; will not easily be equalled.&nbsp; In the
women&rsquo;s part are some defects; the character of Atossa is
not so neatly finished as that of Clodio, and some of the female
characters may be found, perhaps, more frequently among men; what
is said of Philomede was true of Prior.</p>
<p>In the Epistles to Lord Bathurst and Lord Burlington, Dr.
Warburton has endeavoured to find a train of thought which was
never in the writer&rsquo;s head, and, to support his hypothesis,
has printed that first which was published last.&nbsp; In one the
most valuable passage is perhaps the Elegy on Good Sense, and the
other the end of the Duke of Buckingham.</p>
<p>The Epistle to Arbuthnot, now arbitrarily called the
&ldquo;Prologue to the Satires,&rdquo; is a performance
consisting, as it seems, of many fragments wrought into one
design, which, by this union of scattered beauties, contains more
striking paragraphs than could probably have been brought
together into an occasional work.&nbsp; As there is no stronger
motive to exertion than self-defence, no part has more elegance,
spirit, or dignity, than the poet&rsquo;s vindication of his own
character.&nbsp; The meanest passage is the satire upon
Sporus.</p>
<p>Of the two poems which derived their names from the year, and
which are called the &ldquo;Epilogue to the Satires,&rdquo; it
was very justly remarked by Savage that the second was in the
whole more strongly conceived, and more equally supported, but
that it had no single passages equal to the contention in the
first for the dignity of Vice and the celebration of the triumph
of Corruption.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Imitations of Horace&rdquo; seem to have been
written as relaxations of his genius.&nbsp; This employment
became his favourite by its facility; the plan was ready to his
hand, and nothing was required but to accommodate as he could the
sentiments of an old author to recent facts or familiar images;
but what is easy is seldom excellent.&nbsp; Such imitations
cannot give pleasure to common readers; the man of learning may
be sometimes surprised and delighted by an unexpected parallel,
but the comparison requires knowledge of the original, which will
likewise often detect strained applications.&nbsp; Between Roman
images and English manners there will be an irreconcilable
dissimilitude, and the works will be generally uncouth and
parti-coloured, neither original nor translated, neither ancient
nor modern.</p>
<p>Pope had, in proportions very nicely adjusted to each other,
all the qualities that constitute genius.&nbsp; He had
<i>intention</i>, by which new trains of events are formed and
new scenes of imagery displayed, as in the &ldquo;Rape of the
Lock,&rdquo; and by which extrinsic and adventitious
embellishments and illustrations are connected with a known
subject, as in the &ldquo;Essay on Criticism.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
<i>imagination</i>, which strongly impresses on the
writer&rsquo;s mind, and enables him to convey to the reader the
various forms of nature, incidents of life, and energies of
passion, as in his &ldquo;Eloisa,&rdquo; &ldquo;Windsor
Forest,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ethic Epistles.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
<i>judgment</i>, which selects from life or Nature what the
present purpose requires, and by separating the essence of things
from its concomitants, often makes the representation more
powerful than the reality; and he had colours of language always
before him, ready to decorate his matter with every grace of
elegant expression, as when he accommodates his diction to the
wonderful multiplicity of Homer&rsquo;s sentiments and
descriptions.</p>
<p>Poetical expression includes sound as well as meaning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Music,&rdquo; says Dryden, &ldquo;is inarticulate
poetry;&rdquo; among the excellences of Pope, therefore, must be
mentioned the melody of his metre.&nbsp; By perusing the works of
Dryden, he discovered the most perfect fabric of English verse,
and habituated himself to that only which he found the best; in
consequence of which restraint his poetry has been censured as
too uniformly musical, and as glutting the ear with unvaried
sweetness.&nbsp; I suspect this objection to be the cant of those
who judge by principles rather than perception, and who would
even themselves have less pleasure in his works if he had tried
to relieve attention by studied discords, or affected to break
his lines and vary his pauses.&nbsp; But though he was thus
careful of his versification, he did not oppress his powers with
superfluous rigour.&nbsp; He seems to have thought with Boileau
that the practice of writing might be refined till the difficulty
should overbalance the advantage.&nbsp; The construction of the
language is not always strictly grammatical; with those rhymes
which prescription had conjoined he contented himself, without
regard to Swift&rsquo;s remonstrances, though there was no
striking consonance, nor was he very careful to vary his
terminations or to refuse admission, at a small distance, to the
same rhymes.&nbsp; To Swift&rsquo;s edict for the exclusion of
alexandrines and triplets he paid little regard; he admitted
them, but, in the opinion of Fenton, too rarely; he uses them
more liberally in his translation than his poems.&nbsp; He has a
few double rhymes, and always, I think, unsuccessfully, except
once in the &ldquo;Rape of the Lock.&rdquo;&nbsp; Expletives he
very early ejected from his verses, but he now and then admits an
epithet rather commodious than important.&nbsp; Each of the six
first lines of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; might lose two syllables
with very little diminution of the meaning, and sometimes, after
all his art and labour, one verse seems to be made for the sake
of another.&nbsp; In his latter productions the diction is
sometimes vitiated by French idioms, with which Bolingbroke had
perhaps infected him.</p>
<p>I have been told that the couplet by which he declared his own
ear to be most gratified was this:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Lo, where M&aelig;otis sleeps, and
hardly flows<br />
The freezing Tanais through a waste of snows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the reason of this preference I cannot discover.</p>
<p>It is remarked by Watts that there is scarcely a happy
combination of words, or a phrase poetically elegant in the
English language, which Pope has not inserted into his version of
Homer.&nbsp; How he obtained possession of so many beauties of
speech it were desirable to know.&nbsp; That he gleaned from
authors, obscure as well as eminent, what he thought brilliant or
useful, and preserved it all in a regular collection, is not
unlikely.&nbsp; When, in his last years, Hall&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Satires&rdquo; were shown him, he wished that he had seen
them sooner.&nbsp; New sentiments and new images others may
produce; but to attempt any further improvement of versification
will be dangerous.&nbsp; Art and diligence have now done their
best, and what shall be added will be the effort of tedious toil
and needless curiosity.&nbsp; After all this, it is surely
superfluous to answer the question that has once been asked,
Whether Pope was a poet, otherwise than by asking in return, If
Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be found?&nbsp; To
circumscribe poetry by a definition will only show the narrowness
of the definer, though a definition which shall exclude Pope will
not easily be made.&nbsp; Let us look round upon the present time
and back upon the past; let us inquire to whom the voice of
mankind has decreed the wreath of poetry; let their productions
be examined, and their claims stated, and the pretensions of Pope
will be no more disputed.&nbsp; Had he given the world only his
version, the name of poet must have been allowed him: if the
writer of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; were to class his successors he
would assign a very high place to his translator, without
requiring any other evidence of genius.</p>
<p>The following letter, of which the original is in the hands of
Lord Hardwicke, was communicated to me by the kindness of Mr.
Jodrell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Mr. Bridges</span>, <i>at the Bishop of
London&rsquo;s</i>, <i>at Fulham</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The favour of
your letter, with your remarks, can never be enough acknowledged,
and the speed with which you discharged so troublesome a task
doubles the obligation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must own you have pleased me very much by the
commendations so ill bestowed upon me; but I assure you, much
more by the frankness of your censure, which I ought to take the
more kindly of the two, as it is more advantage to a scribbler to
be improved in his judgment than to be smoothed in his
vanity.&nbsp; The greater part of those deviations from the Greek
which you have observed I was led into by Chapman and Hobbes; who
are, it seems, as much celebrated for their knowledge of the
original as they are decried for the badness of their
translations.&nbsp; Chapman pretends to have restored the genuine
sense of the author from the mistakes of all former explainers in
several hundred places; and the Cambridge editors of the large
Homer, in Greek and Latin, attributed so much to Hobbes, that
they confess they have corrected the old Latin interpretation
very often by his version.&nbsp; For my part, I generally took
the author&rsquo;s meaning to be as you have explained it; yet
their authority, joined to the knowledge of my own imperfectness
in the language, overruled me.&nbsp; However, sir, you may be
confident, I think you in the right, because you happen to be of
my opinion; for men (let them say what they will) never approve
any other&rsquo;s sense but as it squares with their own.&nbsp;
But you have made me much more proud of and positive in my
judgment, since it is strengthened by yours.&nbsp; I think your
criticisms which regard the expression very just, and shall make
my profit of them; to give you some proof that I am in earnest, I
will alter three verses on your bare objection, though I have Mr.
Dryden&rsquo;s example for each of them.&nbsp; And this, I hope,
you will account no small piece of obedience, from one who values
the authority of one true poet above that of twenty critics or
commentators.&nbsp; But, though I speak thus of commentators, I
will continue to read carefully all I can procure, to make up
that way for my own want of critical understanding in the
original beauties of Homer.&nbsp; Though the greatest of them are
certainly those of invention and design, which are not at all
confined to the language; for the distinguishing excellences of
Homer are (by the consent of the best critics of all nations),
first in the manners (which include all the speeches, as being no
other than the representations of each person&rsquo;s manners by
his words): and then in that rapture and fire, which carries you
away with him, with that wonderful force, that no man who has a
true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads
him.&nbsp; Homer makes you interested and concerned before you
are aware, all at once, where Virgil does it by soft
degrees.&nbsp; This, I believe, is what a translator of Homer
ought principally to imitate; and it is very hard for any
translator to come up to it, because the chief reason why all
translations fall short of their originals is, that the very
constraint they are obliged to renders them heavy and
dispirited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great beauty of Homer&rsquo;s language, as I take
it, consists in that noble simplicity which runs through all his
works (and yet his diction, contrary to what one would imagine
consistent with simplicity, is at the same time very
copious).&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how I have run into this
pedantry in a letter, but I find I have said too much, as well as
spoken too inconsiderately; what farther thoughts I have upon
this subject I shall be glad to communicate to you (for my own
improvement) when we meet, which is a happiness I very earnestly
desire, as I do likewise some opportunity of proving how much I
think myself obliged to your friendship, and how truly I am,
sir,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The criticism upon Pope&rsquo;s Epitaphs, which was printed in
&ldquo;The Universal Visitor,&rdquo; is placed here, being too
minute and particular to be inserted in the Life.</p>
<p>Every art is best taught by example.&nbsp; Nothing contributes
more to the cultivation of propriety than remarks on the works of
those who have most excelled.&nbsp; I shall therefore endeavour
at this <i>visit</i> to entertain the young students in poetry
with an examination of Pope&rsquo;s Epitaphs.</p>
<p>To define an epitaph is useless; every one knows that it is an
inscription on a tomb.&nbsp; An epitaph, therefore, implies no
particular character of writing, but may be composed in verse or
prose.&nbsp; It is, indeed, commonly panegyrical, because we are
seldom distinguished with a stone but by our friends; but it has
no rule to restrain or mollify it except this, that it ought not
to be longer than common beholders may be expected to have
leisure and patience to peruse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>On</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>Earl of</i> <span
class="smcap">Dorset</span>, <i>in the church of Wythyham in
Sussex</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorset, the grace of courts,
the Muse&rsquo;s pride,<br />
Patron of arts, and judge of nature, died.<br />
The scourge of pride, though sanctified or great,<br />
Of fops in learning, and of knaves in state;<br />
Yet soft in nature, though severe his lay,<br />
His anger moral, and his wisdom gay.<br />
Blest satirist! who touched the means so true,<br />
As showed Vice had his hate and pity too.<br />
Blest courtier! who could king and country please,<br />
Yet sacred kept his friendship and his ease.<br />
Blest peer! his great forefathers&rsquo; every grace<br />
Reflecting, and reflected on his race;<br />
Where other Buckhursts, other Dorsets shine,<br />
And patriots still, or pests, deck the line.</p>
<p>The first distich of this epitaph contains a kind of
information which few would want, that the man for whom the tomb
was erected <i>died</i>.&nbsp; There are indeed some qualities
worthy of the praise ascribed to the dead, but none that were
likely to exempt him from the lot of man, or incline us much to
wonder that he should die.&nbsp; What is meant by &ldquo;judge of
nature&rdquo; is not easy to say.&nbsp; Nature is not the object
of human judgment; for it is in vain to judge where we cannot
alter.&nbsp; If by nature is meant what is commonly called
<i>nature</i> by the critics, a just representation of things
really existing, and actions really performed, nature cannot be
properly opposed to <i>art</i>; nature being, in this sense, only
the best effect of <i>art</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">The scourge of
pride&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of this couplet the second line is not what is intended, an
illustration of the former.&nbsp; <i>Pride</i> in the
<i>Great</i>, is indeed well enough connected with knaves in
state, though <i>knaves</i> is a word rather too ludicrous and
light; but the mention of <i>sanctified</i> pride will not lead
the thoughts to <i>fops in learning</i>, but rather to some
species of tyranny or oppression, something more gloomy and more
formidable than foppery.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Yet soft his
nature&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a high compliment, but was not first bestowed on
Dorset by Pope.&nbsp; The next verse is extremely beautiful.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Blest
satirist!&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this distich is another line of which Pope was not the
author.&nbsp; I do not mean to blame these imitations with much
harshness; in long performances they are scarcely to be avoided,
and in shorter they may be indulged, because the train of the
composition may naturally involve them, or the scantiness of the
subject allow little choice.&nbsp; However, what is borrowed is
not to be enjoyed as our own, and it is the business of critical
justice to give every bird of the Muses his proper feather.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Blest
courtier!&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether a courtier can properly be commended for keeping his
<i>ease sacred</i>, may perhaps be disputable.&nbsp; To please
king and country without sacrificing friendship to any change of
times was a very uncommon instance of prudence or felicity, and
deserved to be kept separate from so poor a commendation as care
of his ease.&nbsp; I wish our poets would attend a little more
accurately to the use of the word <i>sacred</i>, which surely
should never be applied in a serious composition, but where some
reference may be made to a higher Being, or where some duty is
exacted or implied.&nbsp; A man may keep his friendship sacred,
because promises of friendship are very awful ties; but methinks
he cannot, but in a burlesque sense, be said to keep his ease
<i>sacred</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Blest peer!&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blessing ascribed to the <i>peer</i> has no connection
with his peerage; they might happen to any other man whose
posterity were likely to be regarded.</p>
<p>I know not whether this epitaph be worthy either of the writer
or the man entombed.</p>

his place</i>, <i>died in his retirement at Easthamstead</i>,
<i>in Berkshire</i>, <i>1716</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasing form, a firm, yet
cautious mind,<br />
Sincere, though prudent; constant, yet resigned;<br />
Honour unchanged, a principle profest.<br />
Fixed to one side, but moderate to the rest;<br />
An honest courtier, yet a patriot too,<br />
Just to his prince, and to his country true;<br />
Filled with the sense of age, the fire of youth,<br />
A scorn of wrangling, yet a zeal for truth;<br />
A generous faith, from superstition free;<br />
A love to peace, and hate of tyranny;<br />
Such this man was; who new from earth removed<br />
At length enjoys that liberty he loved.</p>
<p>In this epitaph, as in many others, there appears at the first
view a fault which I think scarcely any beauty can
compensate.&nbsp; The name is omitted.&nbsp; The end of an
epitaph is to convey some account of the dead; and to what
purpose is anything told of him whose name is concealed?&nbsp; An
epitaph, and a history of a nameless hero, are equally absurd,
since the virtues and qualities so recounted in either are
scattered at the mercy of fortune to be appropriated by
guess.&nbsp; The name, it is true, may be read upon the stone;
but what obligation has it to the poet, whose verses wander over
the earth and leave their subject behind them, and who is forced,
like an unskilful painter, to make his purpose known by
adventitious help?&nbsp; This epitaph is wholly without
elevation, and contains nothing striking or particular; but the
poet is not to be blamed for the defect of his subject.&nbsp; He
said perhaps the best that could be said.&nbsp; There are,
however, some defects which were not made necessary by the
character in which he was employed.&nbsp; There is no opposition
between an <i>honest courtier</i> and a <i>patriot</i>; for an
<i>honest</i>, <i>courtier</i> cannot but be a
<i>patriot</i>.&nbsp; It was unsuitable to the nicety required in
short compositions to close his verse with the word <i>too</i>;
every rhyme should be a word of emphasis: nor can this rule be
safely neglected, except where the length of the poem makes
slight inaccuracies excusable, or allows room for beauties
sufficient to overpower the effects of petty faults.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the seventh line the word <i>filled</i> is
weak and prosaic, having no particular adaptation to any of the
words that follow it.&nbsp; The thought in the last line is
impertinent, having no connection with the foregoing character,
nor with the condition of the man described.&nbsp; Had the
epitaph been written on the poor conspirator who died lately in
prison, after a confinement of more than forty years, without any
crime proved against him, the sentiment had been just and
pathetical; but why should Trumbull be congratulated upon his
liberty who had never known restraint?</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; How vain is reason, eloquence how weak!<br />
If Pope must tell what Harcourt cannot speak.<br />

And with a father&rsquo;s sorrows mix his own!</p>
<p>This epitaph is principally remarkable for the artful
introduction of the name, which is inserted with a peculiar
felicity, to which chance must concur with genius, which no man
can hope to attain twice, and which cannot be copied but with
servile imitation.&nbsp; I cannot but wish that, of this
inscription, the two last lines had been omitted, as they take
away from the energy what they do not add to the sense.</p>

Who broke no premise, served no private end,<br />
Who gained no title, and who lost no friend;<br />
Ennobled by himself, by all approved,<br />
Praised, wept, and honoured by the Muse he loved.</p>
<p>The lines on Craggs were not originally intended for an
epitaph; and therefore some faults are to be imputed to the
violence with which they are torn from the poems that first
contained them.&nbsp; We may, however, observe some
defects.&nbsp; There is a redundancy of words in the first
couplet: it is superfluous to tell of him, who was
<i>sincere</i>, <i>true</i>, and <i>faithful</i>, that he was
<i>in honour clear</i>.&nbsp; There seems to be an opposition
intended in the fourth line, which is not very obvious: where is
the relation between the two positions, that he <i>gained no
title</i> and <i>lest no friend</i>?</p>
<p>It may be proper here to remark the absurdity of joining in
the same inscription Latin and English or verse and prose.&nbsp;
If either language be preferable to the other, let that only be
used; for no reason can be given why part of the information
should be given in one tongue, and part in another on a tomb,
more than in any other place, or any other occasion; and to tell
all that can be conveniently told in verse, and then to call in
the help of prose, has always the appearance of a very artless
expedient, or of an attempt unaccomplished.&nbsp; Such an epitaph
resembles the conversation of a foreigner, who tells part of his
meaning by words, and conveys part by signs.</p>

Peace to thy gentle shade, and endless rest!<br />
Blest in thy genius, in thy love too blest;<br />
One grateful women to thy fame supplies<br />
What a whole thankless land to his denies.</p>
<p>Of this inscription the chief fault is that it belongs less to
Rowe, for whom it was written, than to Dryden, who was buried
near him; and indeed gives very little information concerning
either.</p>
<p>To wish <i>peace to thy shade</i> is too mythological to be
admitted into a Christian temple: the ancient worship has
infected almost all our other compositions, and might therefore
be contented to spare our epitaphs.&nbsp; Let fiction, at least,
cease with life, and let us be serious over the grave.</p>

Blest with plain reason, and with sober sense;<br />
No conquest she, but o&rsquo;er herself, desired;<br />

Passion and pride were to her soul unknown,<br />
Convinced that Virtue only is our own.<br />
So unaffected, so composed a mind,<br />
So firm, yet soft, so strong, yet so refined,<br />
Heaven, as its purest gold, by tortures tried;<br />
The saint sustained it, but the woman died.</p>
<p>I have always considered this as the most valuable of all
Pope&rsquo;s epitaphs; the subject of it is a character not
discriminated by any shining or eminent peculiarities; yet that
which really makes, though not the splendour, the felicity of
life, and that which every wise man will choose for his final and
lasting companion in the languor of age, in the quiet of privacy,
when he departs weary and disgusted from the ostentatious, the
volatile, and the vain.&nbsp; Of such a character, which the dull
overlook and the gay despise, it was fit that the value should be
made known and the dignity established.&nbsp; Domestic virtue, as
it is exerted without great occasions, or conspicuous
consequences, in an even unnoted tenor, required the genius of
Pope to display it in such a manner as might attract regard and
enforce reverence.&nbsp; Who can forbear to lament that this
amiable woman has no name in the verses?&nbsp; If the particular
lines of this inscription be examined, it will appear less faulty
than the rest.&nbsp; There is scarce one line taken from
commonplaces, unless it be that in which <i>only Virtue</i> is
said to be <i>our own</i>.&nbsp; I once heard a lady of great
beauty and excellence object to the fourth line that it contained
an unnatural and incredible panegyric.&nbsp; Of this let the
ladies judge.</p>

&rsquo;Tis all a father, all a friend can give!</p>
<p>This epitaph contains of the brother only a general
indiscriminate character, and of the sister tells nothing but
that she died.&nbsp; The difficulty in writing epitaphs is to
give a particular and appropriate praise.&nbsp; This, however, is
not always to be performed, whatever be the diligence or ability
of the writer; for the greater part of mankind <i>have no
character at all</i>, have little that distinguishes them from
others, equally good or bad, and therefore nothing can be said of
them which may not be applied with equal propriety to a thousand
more.&nbsp; It is indeed no great panegyric that there is
enclosed in this tomb one who was born in one year, and died in
another; yet many useful and amiable lives have been spent which
yet leave little materials for any other memorial.&nbsp; These
are however not the proper subjects of poetry; and whenever
friendship, or any other motive, obliges a poet to write on such
subjects, he must be forgiven if he sometimes wanders in
generalities, and utters the same praises over different
tombs.</p>
<p>The scantiness of human praises can scarcely be made more
apparent than by remarking how often Pope has, in the few
epitaphs which he composed, found it necessary to borrow from
himself.&nbsp; The fourteen epitaphs which he has written
comprise about a hundred and forty lines, in which there are more
repetitions than will easily be found in all the rest of his
works.&nbsp; In the eight lines which make the character of Digby
there is scarce any thought or word which may not be found in the
other epitaphs.&nbsp; The ninth line, which is far the strongest
and most elegant, is borrowed from Dryden.&nbsp; The conclusion
is the same with that on Harcourt, but is here more elegant and
better connected.</p>

Whose art was Nature, and whose pictures thought;<br />
Now for two ages, having snatched from fate<br />
Whate&rsquo;er was beauteous, or whate&rsquo;er was great,<br />
Lies crowned with Princes, honours, Poets, lays,<br />
Due to his merit, and brave thirst of praise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Living, great Nature feared he might outvie<br />
Her works; and dying, fears herself may die.</p>
<p>Of this epitaph the first couplet is good, the second not bad,
the third is deformed with a broken metaphor, the word crowned
not being applicable to the honours or the lays, and the fourth
is not only borrowed from the epitaph on Raphael, but of a very
harsh construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">IX.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>On General</i> <span
class="smcap">Henry Withers</span>, <i>in Westminster Abbey</i>,
1729.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Withers, rest! thou
bravest, gentlest mind,<br />
Thy country&rsquo;s friend, but more of human kind.<br />
O born to arms!&nbsp; O worth in youth approved!<br />
O soft humanity in age beloved!<br />
For thee the hardy veteran drops a tear,<br />
And the gay courtier feels the sigh sincere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Withers, adieu! yet not will thee remove<br />
Thy martial spirit, or thy social love!<br />
Amidst corruption, luxury, and rage,<br />
Still leave some ancient virtues to our age:<br />
Nor let us say (those English glories gone)<br />
The last true Briton lies beneath this stone.</p>
<p>The epitaph on Withers affords another instance of
commonplaces, though somewhat diversified by mingled qualities,
and the peculiarity of a profession.&nbsp; The second couplet is
abrupt, general, and unpleasing; exclamation seldom succeeds in
our language; and, I think, it may be observed that the particle
O! used at the beginning of a sentence, always offends.&nbsp; The
third couplet is more happy; the value expressed for him, by
different sorts of men, raises him to esteem; there is yet
something of the common cant of superficial satirists, who
suppose that the insincerity of a courtier destroys all his
sensations, and that he is equally a dissembler to the living and
the dead.&nbsp; At the third couplet I should wish the epitaph to
close, but that I should be unwilling to lose the two next lines,
which yet are dearly bought if they cannot be retained without
the four that follow them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">X.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>On Mr.</i> <span
class="smcap">Elijah Fenton</span>, <i>at Easthamstead in
Berkshire</i>, 1730.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This modest stone, what few
vain marbles can,<br />
May truly say, Here lies an honest man:<br />
A poet, blest beyond the poet&rsquo;s fate,<br />
Whom Heaven kept sacred from the Proud and Great:<br />
Foe to loud praise, and friend to learned ease,<br />
Content with science in the vale of peace.<br />
Calmly he looked on either life, and here<br />
Saw nothing to regret or there to fear;<br />
From Nature&rsquo;s temperate feast rose satisfied,<br />
Thanked Heaven that he lived, and that he died.</p>
<p>The first couplet of this epitaph is borrowed from
Crashaw.&nbsp; The four next lines contain a species of praise
peculiar, original, and just.&nbsp; Here, therefore, the
inscription should have ended, the latter part containing nothing
but what is common to every man who is wise and good.&nbsp; The
character of Fenton was so amiable, that I cannot forbear to wish
for some poet or biographer to display it more fully for the
advantage of posterity.&nbsp; If he did not stand in the first
rank of genius, he may claim a place in the second; and, whatever
criticism may object to his writings, censure could find very
little to blame in his life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">XI.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>On Mr.</i> <span
class="smcap">Gay</span>, <i>in Westminster Abbey</i>, 1732.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of manners gentle, of
affections mild;<br />
In wit, a muse; simplicity, a child:<br />
With native humour tempering virtuous rage,<br />
Formed to delight at once and lash the age:<br />
Above temptation, in a low estate,<br />
And uncorrupted, ev&rsquo;n among the Great:<br />
A safe companion and an easy friend,<br />
Unbiased through life, lamented in thy end,<br />
These are thy honours! not that here thy bust<br />
Is mixed with heroes, or with kings thy dust;<br />
But that the worthy and the Good shall say,<br />
Striking their pensive bosoms&mdash;Here lies <span
class="smcap">Gay</span>.</p>
<p>As Gay was the favourite of our author this epitaph was
probably written with an uncommon degree of attention, yet it is
not more successfully executed than the rest, for it will not
always happen that the success of a poet is proportionate to his
labour.&nbsp; The same observation may be extended to all works
of imagination, which are often influenced by causes wholly out
of the performer&rsquo;s power, by hints of which he perceives
not the origin, by sudden elevations of mind which he cannot
produce in himself, and which sometimes rise when he expects them
least.&nbsp; The two parts of the first line are only echoes of
each other; <i>gentle manners</i> and <i>mild affections</i>, if
they mean anything, must mean the same.</p>
<p>That Gay was a <i>man in wit</i> is a very frigid
commendation; to have the wit of a man is not much for a
poet.&nbsp; The <i>wit of man</i> and the <i>simplicity of a
child</i> make a poor and vulgar contrast, and raise no ideas of
excellence, either intellectual or moral.</p>
<p>In the next couplet <i>rage</i> is less properly introduced
after the mention of <i>mildness</i> and <i>gentleness</i>, which
are made the constituents of his character; for a man so
<i>mild</i> and <i>gentle</i> to <i>temper</i> his <i>rage</i>
was not difficult.&nbsp; The next line is inharmonious in its
sound, and mean in its conception; the opposition is obvious, and
the word <i>lash</i> used absolutely, and without any
modification, is gross and improper.&nbsp; To be <i>above
temptation</i> in poverty and <i>free from corruption among the
Great</i> is indeed such a peculiarity as deserved notice.&nbsp;
But to be a <i>safe companion</i> is a praise merely negative,
arising not from possession of virtue but the absence of vice,
and that one of the most odious.</p>
<p>As little can be added to his character by asserting that he
was <i>lamented in his end</i>.&nbsp; Every man that dies is, at
least by the writer of his epitaph, supposed to be lamented, and
therefore this general lamentation does no honour to Gay.</p>
<p>The first eight lines have no grammar; the adjectives are
without any substantive, and the epithets without a
subject.&nbsp; The thought in the last line, that Gay is buried
in the bosoms of the <i>worthy</i> and <i>good</i>, who are
distinguished only to lengthen the line, is so dark that few
understand it, and so harsh, when it is explained, that still
fewer approve.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">XII.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Intended for Sir</i> <span
class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span>, <i>in Westminster
Abbey</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><span
class="smcap">Isaacus Newtonius</span>:<br />
Quem Immortalem<br />
Testantur, <i>Tempus</i>, <i>Natura</i>, <i>C&oelig;lum</i>:<br
/>
Mortalem hoc marmor fatetur.<br />
Nature, and Nature&rsquo;s laws, lay hid in night:<br />
God said, <i>Let Newton be</i>!&nbsp; And all was light.</p>
<p>On this epitaph, short as it is, the faults seem not to be
very few.&nbsp; Why part should be Latin and part English it is
not easy to discover.&nbsp; In the Latin the opposition of
<i>Immortalis</i> and <i>Mortalis</i> is a mere sound, or a mere
quibble; he is not <i>immortal</i> in any sense contrary to that
in which he is <i>mortal</i>.&nbsp; In the verses the thought is
obvious, and the words <i>night</i> and <i>light</i> are too
nearly allied.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">XIII.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>On</i> <span
class="smcap">Edmund</span> <i>Duke of</i> <span
class="smcap">Buckingham</span>, <i>who died in the 19th Year of
his Age</i>, 1735.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If modest youth, with cool
reflection crowned,<br />
And every opening virtue blooming round,<br />
Could save a parent&rsquo;s justest pride from fate,<br />
Or add one patriot to a sinking state;<br />
This weeping marble had not asked thy tear,<br />
Or sadly told how many hopes lie here!<br />
The living virtue now had shone approved,<br />
The senate heard him, and his country loved.<br />
Yet softer honours, and less noisy fame,<br />
Attend the shade of gentle Buckingham:<br />
In whom a race, for courage famed and art,<br />
Ends in the milder merit of the heart;<br />
And, chiefs or sages long to Britain given,<br />
Pays the last tribute of a saint to heaven.</p>
<p>This epitaph Mr. Warburton prefers to the rest, but I know not
for what reason.&nbsp; To <i>crown</i> with <i>reflection</i> is
surely a mode of speech approaching to nonsense.&nbsp; <i>Opening
virtues blooming round</i> is something like tautology; the six
following lines are poor and prosaic.&nbsp; <i>Art</i> is in
another couplet used for <i>arts</i>, that a rhyme may be had to
<i>heart</i>.&nbsp; The six last lines are the best, but not
excellent.</p>
<p>The rest of his sepulchral performances hardly deserve the
notice of criticism.&nbsp; The contemptible dialogue between He
and She should have been suppressed for the author&rsquo;s
sake.</p>
<p>In his last epitaph on himself, in which he attempts to be
jocular upon one of the few things that make wise men serious, he
confounds the living man with the dead:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Under this stone, or under this sill,<br
/>
Or under this turf, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a man is once buried, the question, under what he is
buried, is easily decided.&nbsp; He forgot that though he wrote
the epitaph in a state of uncertainty, yet it could not be laid
over him till his grave was made.&nbsp; Such is the folly of wit
when it is ill employed.</p>
<p>The world has but little new, even this wretchedness seems to
have been borrowed from the following tuneless lines:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Ludovici Areosti humantur ossa<br />
Sub hoc marmore, vel sub hac humo, seu<br />
Sub quicquid voluit benignus h&aelig;res<br />
Siv h&aelig;rede benignior comes, seu<br />
Opportunius incidens Viator:<br />
Nam scire haud potuit futura, sed nec<br />
Tanti erat vacuum sibi cadaver<br />
Ut utnam cuperet parere vivens,<br />
Vivens ista tamen sibi paravit.<br />
Qu&aelig; inscribi voluit suo sepulchro<br />
Olim siquod haberetis sepulchrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely Ariosto did not venture to expect that his trifle would
have ever had such an illustrious imitator.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
